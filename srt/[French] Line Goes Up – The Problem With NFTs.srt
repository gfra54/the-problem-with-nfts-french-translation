00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,120
For online content creators the unavoidable 
subject of 2021 has been NFT’s. 

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,080
From incredibly cringe-worthy ape profile pics, to 
incomprehensibly tasteless tributes to deceased  

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,920
celebrities, to six-figure sales of the “original 
copy” of a meme, it is the thing that is currently  

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,720
dominating the collective brain space of digital 
artists and sucking up all the oxygen in the room.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,520
And I do want to talk about that, I want to 
talk about my opinions on NFTs and digital  

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,840
ownership and scarcity, all the myriad 
dimensions of the issue, but I don’t  

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,440
just want to talk about NFTs, I can’t just talk 
about NFTs because ultimately they are just  

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,720
a symbol of so much more, and it is that 
“more” that is ultimately important.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:57,840
So let me tell you a story.

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
[Drumming]

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
In 2008 the economy functionally collapsed.

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,520
The basic chain reaction was this:

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,400
Banks came up with a thing called 
a mortgage-backed security,  

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
a financial instrument that could be traded 
or collected that was based on a bundle  

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,680
of thousands of individual mortgages. Based on the 
general reluctance of banks to issue mortgages,  

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,640
the risk-aversion in lending someone hundreds 
of thousands of dollars that they’ll pay off  

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,720
over the course of decades, these bonds 
were seen as especially stable. However  

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,440
they were also immensely profitable for the 
banks who both issue the mortgages and the bonds.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,120
Because of that perceived stability a 
lot of other financial organizations,  

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,240
like pension funds and hedge funds, used them 
as the backbone of their investment portfolio.

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,960
In this arrangement a mortgage becomes more 
profitable to the bank issuing the mortgage  

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,800
as a component of a bond than it is as a 
mortgage. Proportionally the returns per  

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,600
mortgage from the bond are just that much better 
than the returns from the isolated mortgage.

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,240
There’s some problems, though. Problem one is 
that the biggest returns on a bond come from  

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,040
when it first hits the market, a new bond 
that creates new securities sales is worth  

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,280
more than an old bond that is slowly appreciating, 
but not seeing much trade. Problem two  

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,880
is that there are a finite number 
of people and houses in America;  

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,680
the market has to level out at a natural 
ceiling as eventually all or nearly all  

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,880
mortgages are packaged into bonds, thus very 
few new bonds can be generated and sold.

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
So here’s the incentives that are created.

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,440
One: it’s good for banks if there are more 
houses that they can issue mortgages for 

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,320
Two: the more mortgages issued the 
better, because a bad mortgage is  

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,920
worth more as a component of a bond than 
a good mortgage that’s not part of a bond.

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,960
So real estate developers find that they have a 
really easy time getting funding from banks for  

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,880
creating vast new suburbs full of houses 
that can be sold to generate mortgages,  

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,120
but rather than building the kind of 
housing most people actually need and want,  

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,400
they focus specifically on the kinds of 
upper-middle-class houses that fit into the sweet  

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,680
spot from the perspective of the banks packaging 
the bonds. Buyers, in turn, find that they have a  

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,600
suspiciously easy time getting a mortgage despite 
the fact that, for most people, the economy wasn’t  

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,200
doing so great. Wages were stagnant and yet even 
though developers were going absolutely haywire  

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,520
building new housing, the houses being built 
were all out of their price range to begin with,  

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,640
and counter intuitively this massive increase 
in supply wasn’t driving down the price.

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,760
This is because the houses were being bought, just 
mostly not by people intending to live in them.  

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,400
They were being bought by speculators who 
would then maybe rent them out or often just  

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
leave them vacant with the intent 
to sell a couple years later.

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,800
Because speculators were buying up the supply 
it created synthetic demand. The price keeps  

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,480
going up because speculators keep buying, which 
creates the illusion that the value is going up,  

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,600
which attracts more speculators who buy up 
more supply and further inflate the price.

49
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,160
These speculators are enabled by a system 
that is prioritizing generating new mortgages  

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
purely for the sake of having more 
mortgages to package into bonds.  

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
The down payments are low and the mortgages 
all have a really attractive teaser rate,  

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,280
meaning that for the first three to seven years of 
the mortgage the monthly payments are rock bottom,  

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,480
as low as a few hundred dollars per month against 
a mortgage that would normally charge thousands.

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,560
Caught up in all this are legitimate 
buyers who have been lured into signing  

55
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,640
for a mortgage that they can’t afford 
by aggressive salespeople who have an  

56
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,040
incentive to generate mortgages that they can 
then sell to a bank who can put it into a bond  

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,840
to sell to pension funds to make a line go 
up, because it’s good when the line goes up.

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
It’s a bubble.

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,560
The bubble burst as the teaser rates 
on the mortgages started to expire,  

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
the monthly cost jumped up, and 
since the demand was synthetic  

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
there were no actual buyers for the 
speculators to sell the houses to.

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,040
So the speculators start dumping stock, which 
finally drives prices down, but because the  

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,880
original price was so inflated the new price 
is still out of reach of most actual buyers.

64
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
Legitimate buyers caught in the 
middle find their rates jumping, too,  

65
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,880
but because the price of the house is going 
down as speculators try and dump their stock  

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,800
the price of the house goes down 
relative to the mortgage issued,  

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,120
and thus they can’t refinance and are 
locked into paying the original terms.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
Unable to sell the house and unable 
to afford the monthly payments,  

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,840
the owners, legitimate and speculators, 
default on their mortgages, they stop paying.

70
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Eventually the default rate reaches 
criticality and the bonds fail.  

71
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,640
As the bonds fail this impacts all the first order 
buyers of the bonds, hedge funds, pension funds,  

72
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,920
retirement savings funds, and the like. 
It also cascades through all derivatives,  

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,120
which are financial products that take their 
value directly from the value of the bond.

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,400
This creates a knock-on effect: huge segments 
of the economy turn out to be dead trees,  

75
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,560
rotten to the core, but as a rotten tree falls  

76
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
it still shreds its neighbours 
and crushes anything below it.

77
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,320
It was a failure precipitated by a 
combination of greed, active fraud,  

78
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,360
and willful blindness at all levels of power. 
The banks issuing the bad mortgages were the same  

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,000
banks selling the bonds and providing the capital 
to build the houses to generate the mortgages.  

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,480
The ratings agencies checking the bonds were, 
themselves, publicly traded and dependent  

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,120
on being in good relations with the banks, 
incentivized to rubber stamp whatever rating  

82
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,240
would make their client happy. The regulatory 
agencies that should have seen the problem coming  

83
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,920
were gutted by budget cuts and mired 
in conflicts of interest as employees  

84
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,080
used their positions in regulation to 
secure higher paying jobs in industry.  

85
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,040
And, the cherry on top, the people largely 
responsible for it all knew that because they  

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,000
and their toxic products were so interwoven into 
the foundations of the economy they could count  

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,840
on a bailout from the government because no matter 
how rotten they were, they were very large trees.

88
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
[Drumming]

89
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,280
This naked display of greed and fraud 
created what would be fertile soil for  

90
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,640
both anti-capitalist movements 
and hyper-capitalist movements:  

91
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,280
both groups of people who saw themselves as 
being screwed over by the system, with one  

92
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,040
group diagnosing the problem as the system’s 
inherently corrupt and corrupting incentives,  

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,440
and the other seeing the crisis as a consequence 
of too much regulation, too much exclusion.

94
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
The hyper-capitalist, or anarcho-capitalist 
argument is that in a less constrained  

95
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,520
market there would be more incentive to call 
foul, that regulation had only succeeded in  

96
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,320
creating an in-group that was effectively 
able to conspire without competition.

97
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,440
Of course this argument fails to 
consider that a substantial number of  

98
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,240
people within the system did, in fact, get 
fabulously wealthy specifically by betting  

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
against the synthetic success 
of the market, but regardless.

100
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,920
Into this environment in 2009 arrived Bitcoin, 
an all-electronic peer-to-peer currency.  

101
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,280
Philosophically Bitcoin, and 
cryptocurrency in general,  

102
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,520
was paraded as an end to banks 
and centralized currency.

103
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,200
This is what will form the bedrock, 
both philosophical and technological,  

104
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,560
that NFTs will be built on 
top of. It’s a bit of a hike  

105
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,919
from here to the Bored Ape Yacht Club, 
so I guess get ready for that. Strap in.

106
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,599
As we get into this we’re going to need to deal 
with a lot of vocabulary, and a lot of complexity.  

107
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,880
Some of this is the result of systems 
that are very technically intricate,  

108
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
and some of this is from systems that 
are poorly designed or deliberately  

109
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
obtuse in order to make them difficult to 
understand and thus appear more legitimate.

110
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,280
The entire subject sits at the intersection 
of two fields that are notoriously prone to  

111
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,440
hype-based obfuscation, computer tech and finance, 
and inherits a lot of bad habits from both,  

112
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
with a reputation for making things 
deliberately more difficult to understand  

113
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,720
specifically to create the illusion that 
only they are smart enough to understand it.

114
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,840
Mining and minting are both methods for making 
tokens, which are the base thing that blockchains  

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,200
deal with, but the two are colloquially different 
processes, where mining is a coin token created as  

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,160
a result of the consensus protocol and minting 
is a user-initiated addition of a token to a  

117
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,800
blockchain. All blockchains are made of nodes, 
and these nodes can be watcher nodes, miner nodes,  

118
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
or validator nodes, though most miner nodes are 
also validator nodes. Fractionalization is the  

119
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,960
process of taking one asset and creating a new 
asset that represents portions of the original.

120
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,960
So you get $DOG, a memecoin crypto DeFi venture 
capital fund backed by the fractionalization of  

121
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,680
the original Doge meme sold as an NFT 
to PleasrDAO on the Ethereum network.

122
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,920
I’m sorry, some of this is 
just going to be like that.

123
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,240
The idea behind cryptocurrency is that 
your digital wallet functions the same as  

124
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,800
a bank account, there’s no need for a bank 
to hold and process your transactions because  

125
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,600
rather than holding a sum that conceptually 
represents physical currency, the cryptocoins  

126
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,120
in your cryptowallet are the actual money. And 
because this money isn’t issued by a government  

127
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,240
it is resistant to historical cash crises like 
hyperinflation caused by governments devaluing  

128
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,760
their currency on purpose or by accident. It 
brings the flexibility and anonymity of cash and  

129
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,520
barter to the digital realm, allowing individuals 
to transact without oversight or intermediaries.

130
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,440
And in a one-paragraph pitch you can see the 
appeal, there’s a compelling narrative there.

131
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,240
But, of course, in the twelve years since 
then none of that played out as designed.  

132
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Bitcoin was structurally too slow and 
expensive to handle regular commerce.  

133
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,560
The whole thing basically came out the 
gate as a speculative financial vehicle  

134
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
and so the only consumer market 
that proved to be a viable use  

135
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,520
was buying and selling prohibited drugs where 
the high fees, rapid price fluctuations,  

136
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,320
and multi-hour transaction times were mitigated 
by receiving LSD in the mail a week later.

137
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,880
And as far as banking is concerned, Bitcoin 
was never designed to solve the actual problems  

138
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,400
created by the banking industry, only to be the 
new medium by which they operated. The principal  

139
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,280
offering wasn’t revolution, but at best a changing 
of the guard. The gripe is not with the outcomes  

140
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,680
of 2008, but the fact that you had to be well 
connected in order to get in on the grift in 2006.

141
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,480
And even the change of the guard is an illusion. 
Old money finance assholes like the Winkelvoss  

142
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,360
twins were some of the first big names to jump 
on to crypto, where they remain to this day.

143
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
Financial criminal Jordan Belfort, convicted 
of fraud for running pump and dump schemes  

144
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,560
and barred for life from trading regulated 
securities or acting as a broker, loves Crypto.

145
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,640
Venture capitalist Chris Dixon, who has 
made huge bank off the “old web” in his  

146
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,040
role as a general partner at VC firm Andreessen 
Horowitz Capital Management, is super popular  

147
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,960
in the NFT space. He likes to paint himself as 
an outsider underdog fighting the gatekeepers,  

148
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,480
but he also sits on the boards of 
Coinbase, a large cryptocurrency  

149
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,840
exchange that makes money by being 
the gatekeeper collecting a fee on  

150
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,680
all entries and exits to the crypto economy, and 
Oculus VR, which is owned by Meta, nee Facebook.

151
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,800
Peter Thiel, who also went from wealthy to 
ultra-wealthy off the Web2 boom via PayPal,  

152
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
loves crypto, and is friends with 
a bunch of eugenics advocates who  

153
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,920
promote cryptocurrency as a return to “sound 
money” for a whole bunch of extremely racist  

154
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,040
reasons because when they start talking 
about banks and bankers, they mean Jews.

155
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,160
Some of the largest institutional 
holders of cryptocurrency  

156
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,480
are the exact same investment banks 
that created the subprime loan crash.

157
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,720
Rather than being a reprieve to the 
people harmed by the housing bubble,  

158
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,400
the people whose savings and 
retirements were, unknown to them,  

159
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,880
being gambled on smoke, cryptocurrency instantly 
became the new playground for smoke vendors.

160
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,360
This is a really important point to stress: 
cryptocurrency does nothing to address 99% of  

161
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,800
the problems with the banking industry, because 
those problems are patterns of human behaviour.  

162
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,680
They’re incentives, they’re social structures, 
they’re modalities. The problem is what people  

163
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,320
are doing to others, not that the building they’re 
doing it in has the word “bank” on the outside.

164
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,760
In addition to not fixing problems, Bitcoin 
also came with a pretty substantial drawback.

165
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,320
The innovation of Bitcoin over previous attempts 
at digital currency was to employ a distributed  

166
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,680
append-only ledger, a kind of database where new 
entries can only be added to the end, and then to  

167
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,360
have several different nodes, called validators, 
compete over who gets to validate the next update.

168
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,480
These are, respectively, the blockchain, 
and proof-of-work verification.

169
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Now, proof-of-work has an interesting 
history as a technology, typically being  

170
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,920
deployed as a deterrent to misbehaviour. For 
example, if you require that for every email  

171
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,520
sent the user’s computer has to complete a 
small math problem it places a trivial load  

172
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,000
onto normal users sending a few dozen, 
or even a couple hundred emails a day,  

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,600
but places a massive load on the infrastructure 
of anyone attempting to spam millions of emails.

174
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
How it works in Bitcoin, simply put, is 
that when a block of transactions are  

175
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,800
ready to be recorded to the ledger all of the 
mining nodes in the network compete with one  

176
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,080
another to solve a cryptographic math problem 
that’s based on the data inside the block.

177
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,760
Effectively they’re competing to figure out 
the equation that yields a specific result  

178
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,400
when the contents of the block are fed into 
it, with the complexity of the desired result  

179
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,600
getting deliberately more difficult based on the 
total processing power available to the network.

180
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Once the math problem has been solved the 
rest of the validation network can easily  

181
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,800
double-check the work, since the contents of 
the block can be fed into the proposed solution  

182
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,080
and it either spits out the valid answer or fails.

183
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,000
If the equation works and the consensus 
of validators signs off on it the block  

184
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
is added to the bottom of the ledger and 
the miner who solved the problem first  

185
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,080
is rewarded with newly generated Bitcoin.

186
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,560
The complexity of the answer that the computers 
are trying to solve scales up based on the  

187
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,000
network’s processing power specifically to 
incur heavy diminishing returns as a protection  

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,440
against an attack on the network where someone 
just builds a bigger computer and takes over.

189
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,240
Critics pointed out that 
this created new problems:  

190
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,600
adversarial validation would deliberately incur 
escalating processing costs, which would in turn  

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,520
generate perverse structural incentives 
that would quickly reward capital holders  

192
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,080
and lock out any individual that wasn’t already 
obscenely wealthy, because while the escalating  

193
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,200
proof-of-work scheme incurs heavy diminishing 
returns, diminishing returns are still returns,  

194
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,920
so more would always go to those with 
the resources to build the bigger rig.

195
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
No matter what Bitcoin future was envisioned,  

196
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,640
in the here and now computer 
hardware can be bought with dollars.

197
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,040
Rather than dismantling corrupt power structures,  

198
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,320
this would just become a new 
tool for existing wealth.

199
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,840
And that’s… exactly what happened.

200
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,880
Thus began an arms race for bigger and bigger 
processing rigs, followed by escalating demands  

201
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,880
for the support systems, hardware engineers, HVAC, 
and operating space needed to put those rigs in.

202
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,480
And, don’t worry, we’re not 
forgetting the power requirements.

203
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,960
These rigs draw an industrial amount of 
power and, because of the winner-takes-all  

204
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,080
nature of the competition, huge amounts of 
redundant work are being done and discarded.

205
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,560
Estimates for this power consumption are 
hard to verify, the data is very complex,  

206
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,000
spread across hundreds of operators 
around the globe, who move frequently  

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,040
in search of cheap electricity, and 
it’s all pretty heavily politicized.

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,240
But even conservative estimates from within the 
crypto-mining industry puts the sum energy cost  

209
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,680
of Bitcoin processing on par with the power 
consumption of a small industrialized nation.

210
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,880
Now, evangelists will counter that the global 
banking industry also uses a lot of power,  

211
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,880
gesturing at things like idle ATMs humming away 
all night long, which is strictly speaking,  

212
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,400
not untrue. On a factual level the 
entire global banking industry does,  

213
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,680
in fact, use a lot of total electricity.

214
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,400
But, for scale, it takes six hours of that 
sustained power draw for the Bitcoin network  

215
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,640
to process as many transactions 
as VISA handles in one minute,  

216
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,359
and during that time VISA is using fractions 
of a cent of electricity per transaction.

217
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,680
And that’s just VISA. That’s 
one major institution.

218
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,600
So, like, yes, globally the entirety of the 
banking industry consumes a lot of power,  

219
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,840
and a non-trivial portion of that is 
waste that could be better allocated.  

220
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,920
But it’s also the global banking 
industry for seven billion people,  

221
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,520
and not the hobby horse of a few 
hundred thousand gambling addicts.

222
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,720
So just to head all this off at the pass, 
Bitcoin and proof-of-work cryptocurrency aren’t  

223
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,840
incentivizing a move to green energy sources, 
like solar and wind, they are offsetting it.

224
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,200
Because electrical consumption, electrical 
waste, is the value that underpins Bitcoin.  

225
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Miners spend X dollars in electricity to 
mine a Bitcoin, they expect to be able to  

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,960
sell that coin for at least X plus profit. 
When new power sources come online and the  

227
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:27,840
price of electricity goes down, they don’t 
let X go down, they build a bigger machine.

228
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:27,963
[Drumming]

229
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:32,320
In 2012 Vitalik Buterin, a crypto 
enthusiast and butthurt Warlock main  

230
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,640
set out to fix what he saw as the 
failings and inflexibilities of Bitcoin.

231
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,840
Rather than becoming the new digital currency, 
a thing that people actually used to buy stuff,  

232
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,280
Bitcoin had become an unwieldy 
speculative financial instrument,  

233
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,720
too slow and expensive to use for anything 
other than stunt purchases of expensive cars.

234
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,960
It was infested with money 
laundering and mired in bad press.

235
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,600
After the FBI shut down Silk Road you 
couldn’t even buy drugs with it anymore.

236
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
In practice you couldn’t do anything 
with your Bitcoin but bet on it,  

237
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,400
lock up money you already have in the hopes 
that Bitcoin goes up later, and pray you don’t  

238
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,520
lose it all in a scam, lose access to your 
wallet, or have it all stolen by an exchange.

239
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,040
The result, launched in 2014, was Ethereum, a 
competing cryptocurrency that boasted lower fees,  

240
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,160
faster transaction times, a 
reduced electrical footprint,  

241
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,920
and, most notably, a sophisticated 
processing functionality.

242
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,840
While the Bitcoin blockchain only tracks 
the location and movement of Bitcoins,  

243
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,480
Ethereum would be broader. In addition to 
tracking Ether coins, the ledger would also  

244
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,640
be able to track arbitrary blocks of data. 
As long as they were compatible with the  

245
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,320
structure of the Ethereum network, 
those blocks of data could even be  

246
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,600
programs that would utilize the validation 
network as a distributed virtual machine.

247
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,080
Vitalik envisioned this as a vast, infinite 
machine, duplicated and distributed across  

248
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,680
thousands or millions of computers, a system onto 
which the entire history of a new internet could  

249
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,120
be immutably written, immune to censorship, 
and impossible for governments to take down.

250
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,240
He saw it dismantling banks and other intermediary 
industries, allowing everyone to be their own  

251
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,360
bank, to be their own stock broker, to bypass 
governments, regulators, and insurance agencies.

252
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,800
His peers envisioned a future 
where Ethereum became not just  

253
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,320
a repository of financial transactions, but 
of identity, with deeds, driver’s licenses,  

254
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
professional credentials, medical 
records, educational achievements,  

255
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,880
and employment history turned into tokens and 
stored immutable and eternal on the chain.

256
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
Through crypto and the ethereum 
virtual machine they could bring all  

257
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
the benefits of Wall Street 
investors and Silicon Valley  

258
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,760
venture capitalists to the poorest people 
of the world, the unbanked and forgotten.

259
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,440
This heady high-minded philosophy 
is outlined in great detail in the  

260
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,760
journalistic abortion The Infinite Machine 
by failed-journalist-turned-crypto-shill  

261
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,640
Camilla Russo.

262
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
The book is actually really interesting.

263
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,160
Not for the merits of the writing, Russo fails 
to interrogate the validity or rationality of  

264
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,960
even the simplest claims and falls just 
shy of hagiography by occasionally noting  

265
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,880
that something was a bit tacky or 
embarrassing, but only just shy.

266
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,680
She tells florid stories about the impoverished 
people that Vitalik and friends claimed to be  

267
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,720
working to save, but never once considers that 
the solutions offered might not actually work,  

268
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,200
or that the people claiming to want to solve 
those problems might not even be working on them.

269
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,680
That’s actually a big issue, since the entire 
crypto space, during the entire time that  

270
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,040
Russo’s book covers, was absolutely awash with 
astroturfing schemes where two guys would go to  

271
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,920
some small community in Laos or Angola, take 
a bunch of pictures of people at a “crypto  

272
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,960
investing seminar”, generate some headlines 
for their coin or fund, and then peace out.

273
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,200
For years dudes were going around asking 
vendors if they could slap a Bitcoin  

274
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,160
sticker onto the back of the cash register, 
because the optics of making it look like a  

275
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,600
place takes Bitcoin was cheaper and easier 
than actually using Bitcoin as a currency.

276
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
We have an entire decade of 
credulous articles about how  

277
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
Venezuela and Chile are on the verge 
of switching entirely to crypto,  

278
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,720
based entirely on the claim of two 
trust fund dudes from San Bernardino.

279
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,360
A whole ten years littered with discarded 
press releases about Dell and Microsoft and  

280
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,800
Square bringing crypto to the consumers 
before just quietly discontinuing their  

281
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,000
services after a year or two when they 
realize the demand isn’t actually there.

282
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,400
The fact that the development of Ethereum was 
extremely dependent on a $100,000 fellowship  

283
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,880
grant from Peter Thiel is mentioned, but the 
ideological implications of that connection  

284
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,280
are never explored, the entire subject occupies 
a single paragraph sprinkled as flavour into a  

285
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,320
story about Vitalik and his co-developers airing 
their grievances about some petty infighting.

286
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,720
The book is mostly useful for it’s value 
as a point of reference against reality.  

287
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,080
It’s a very thorough, if uncritical, 
document of absolutely insane claims.

288
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,280
“The idea was that traits of 
blockchain technology—such  

289
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,680
as having no central point of failure, being 
uncensorable, cutting out intermediaries,  

290
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,920
and being immutable—could also benefit 
other applications besides money.  

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,640
Financial instruments like stocks and bonds, and 
commodities like gold, were the obvious targets,  

292
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,440
but people were also talking about putting other 
representations of value like property deeds and  

293
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,720
medical records on the blockchain, too. Those 
efforts—admirable considering Bitcoin hadn’t,  

294
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,600
and still hasn’t, been adopted widely 
as currency—were known as Bitcoin 2.0.”

295
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
I love this paragraph because it 
outlines just how disconnected  

296
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
from reality the people actually 
building cryptocurrencies really are.

297
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,400
They don’t understand anything about the 
ecosystems they’re trying to disrupt,  

298
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,480
they only know that these are things 
that can be conceptualized as valuable  

299
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,320
and assume that because they understand one very 
complicated thing, programming with cryptography,  

300
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,760
that all other complicated things must 
be lesser in complexity and naturally  

301
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,680
lower in the hierarchy of reality, nails easily 
driven by the hammer that they have created.

302
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,080
The idea of putting medical records on a 
public, decentralized, trustless blockchain  

303
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,320
is absolutely nightmarish, and anyone who 
proposes it should be instantly discredited.

304
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,240
The fact that Russo fails to question 
any of this is journalistic malpractice.

305
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,840
Now, in terms of improvements over 
Bitcoin, Ethereum has many. It’s not hard.

306
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,120
Bitcoin sucks.

307
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,160
In terms of problems with Bitcoin, 
Ethereum solves none of them and  

308
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,080
introduces a whole new suite of problems 
driven by the technofetishistic egotism of  

309
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,160
assuming that programmers are uniquely 
suited to solve society’s problems.

310
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,320
Vitalik wants his invention to be 
an infinite machine, so let’s ask  

311
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,640
what that machine is built to do.

312
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
[Drumming]

313
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,320
In order to really understand the full 
scope of this we do need to dig a bit  

314
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,480
more into the technical aspects, 
because that technical functionality  

315
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,200
informs the way the rest of the system behaves.

316
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,240
In a very McLuhanist way, the machine 
shapes the environment around it.

317
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,720
As already mentioned, a blockchain consists 
of two broad fundamental components:  

318
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
the ledger and the consensus mechanism.

319
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
All currently popular blockchains 
use an append-only ledger.

320
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,240
Now this is, on its own, not that remarkable. 
Append-only is just a database setting that only  

321
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,120
allows new entries to be added to the end of the 
current database, once something is written to the  

322
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,480
database it’s read-only. Standard applications 
are typically things like activity logs,  

323
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,600
which is conceptually all a blockchain 
really is: a giant log of transactions.

324
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,320
The hitch is that it’s decentralized, with 
elective participants hosting a complete copy  

325
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,120
of the entire log, and this is where the second 
component comes in, the consensus mechanism.

326
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,840
All validating participants, called nodes, 
have a complete copy of the database,  

327
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,920
and no one copy is considered 
to be the authoritative copy.

328
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,640
Instead there is a consensus mechanism that 
determines which transactions actually happened.

329
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
This is all the proof of work stuff.

330
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,280
Proof of work isn’t the only consensus mechanism,  

331
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,520
but it’s popular because it’s very easy 
to implement by just cloning Bitcoin  

332
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520
and is resilient against the kinds of 
attacks that crypto enthusiasts care about.

333
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,120
It’s a very brute-force solution,  

334
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,440
but legitimately if you want a network of 
ledgers where no one trusts anyone else,  

335
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,360
just making everyone on the network do extreme 
amounts of wasted, duplicate work is a solution.

336
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,200
One of the major problems that this machine 
solves is what’s called the double-spend  

337
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,760
problem: how do you stop someone 
from spending the same dollar twice?

338
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,080
If someone tries, how do you determine 
which transaction really happened?

339
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,640
Banks solve this problem by not correlating 
account balance with any specific dollar,  

340
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,520
processing transactions first-come-first-serve, 
which they track with central resources,  

341
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,880
and punishing users with overdraft 
fees for double-spending.

342
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,440
Eschewing a central solution, cryptocurrencies 
rely on their consensus mechanism.

343
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,800
The most popular alternative to 
proof-of-work is proof-of-stake,  

344
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,400
where validators post collateral of some kind, 
usually whatever currency is endemic to the chain,  

345
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,120
with the amount of collateral determining their 
odds of being rewarded the validation bounty  

346
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,400
for any given transaction. The main proposal of 
proof of stake is that it significantly reduces  

347
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,200
the wasted power problems of proof of work, 
but it’s less resilient than proof of work.

348
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,320
On the energy cost side of things, proof of stake 
is still inefficient, just by virtue of the sheer  

349
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,920
volume of redundancy, but on a per-user basis 
it’s at least inefficient on the scale of, like,  

350
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,760
an MMO as opposed to a steel foundry.

351
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,920
This is difficult to assess because the 
most popular proof of stake chains are still  

352
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,000
unpopular and low traffic in the 
scope of things, heavily centralized.  

353
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,240
Claims about scalability are backed 
up by nothing but the creators’ word.

354
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,160
Proof of stake is also significantly more 
complex because there now needs to be some  

355
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,560
mechanism for determining who gets to do the 
validations, and also determining how audits  

356
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,760
are conducted, and then the question 
of who has control over that system,  

357
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,000
and whether or not someone can gain control of 
that system or control over the whole stake,  

358
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
via just buying out the staking 
pool, et cetera et cetera et cetera.

359
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,000
Proof of Stake also, even more explicitly, 
rewards the wealthy who have the capital  

360
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,600
to both stake and spend. It’s also even more 
explicitly exclusionary. Ethereum’s proposed  

361
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,760
proof-of-stake migration has a buy-in of 32 Ether, 
which at the time of writing is about $130,000,  

362
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,160
so really only early adopters 
and the wealthy can actually  

363
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,200
meaningfully participate 
for more than just crumbs.

364
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,680
This is, in turn, compounding inherent problems 
with the long term growth of the chain.  

365
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,280
Even if you solve the escalating 
power requirements of proof of work,  

366
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,240
the data requirements of storing the chain 
and participating as a validator are also  

367
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,680
prohibitive in a way that inevitably centralizes 
power in the hands of a few wealthy operators.

368
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,920
Vitalik: 85 terabytes per year is 
actually fine, right? Like, because, uh,  

369
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,560
85 terabytes per year, like, if you have, if 
you have even one person that just keeps buying,  

370
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,920
like, um, a hundred dollar hard drive, like, uh, 
I think once every month then they can store it,  

371
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,840
right, like it’s something like that. So, it’s 
too big for just like a casual user that just  

372
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,400
wants to run the chain on their laptop, but one 
dedicated user who cares, they can totally afford  

373
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,080
to, uh, afford to store the chain. And so 85 
terabytes, not a big deal, right, but once you  

374
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,320
crank that number higher there comes a point 
at which it starts becoming a really big deal.

375
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,720
The major downside of all these systems is 
that they’re extremely slow. Proof of work  

376
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,560
is inefficient by design, and proof of stake 
has multiple layers of lottery that need to  

377
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,520
be executed before any transaction can 
be conducted, and in particular suffers  

378
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,000
from delays when elected validators are 
offline and the system needs to draw again.

379
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,800
As an extension of being slow 
they’re also prone to getting  

380
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,720
overwhelmed if too many people try 
to make transactions simultaneously,  

381
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,200
which can cause de-syncs between validators 
and even lead to what’s called a fork,  

382
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,320
where two or more pools of validators reach a 
different consensus about the state of the network  

383
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,320
and each branch keeps on going afterwards 
assuming that it is the authoritative version.

384
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Forks can also be caused on purpose, and this 
is, in fact, the only way to effectively undo  

385
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,520
transactions. Like if someone stole your 
coins the only way to get them back would  

386
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,240
be to convince the people who manage the 
chain itself to negotiate a rollback.

387
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,200
That’s foreshadowing for later.

388
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,960
Now, because the nature of a fork involves 
a disagreement on what transactions  

389
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,000
actually happened, and who got paid for those 
transactions, this means that each arm of the  

390
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,080
fork has a vested interest in its own arm being 
the authoritative arm, so resolving forks can turn  

391
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,800
into irreconcilable schisms, which is funny as 
an outside observer viewing it as inane internet  

392
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,000
drama, but is frankly unacceptable for anything 
posturing as a serious and legitimate currency.

393
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,040
Like, it’s important to stress that 
because of the nature of the chain,  

394
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,440
the way that the ID numbers of later blocks are 
dependent on the outcomes of previous blocks,  

395
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,400
these aren’t just a few disputed transactions 
that need to be resolved between the buyer,  

396
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,120
the seller, and the payment processor, 
these are disagreements on the fundamental  

397
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,960
state of the entire economy that 
create an entire alternate reality.

398
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,960
It’s an ecosystem that absolutely 
demolishes consumer protections  

399
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,960
and makes the re-implementation 
of them extremely difficult.

400
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,960
One of the big selling points of all this 
technology is that it’s particularly secure,  

401
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,200
very difficult for anyone to hack it 
directly, since there’s so much redundancy.

402
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,800
A lot of hay is made about the system’s 
resiliency against man-in-the-middle  

403
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,240
attacks, which are your classic 
Hollywood hacker type attacks.

404
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,360
Someone sends a command from point A and on the 
way to point B it is intercepted and altered.  

405
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,880
Someone hacks into the bank and adds an arbitrary 
number of zeroes onto their account balance.

406
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,920
Evangelists will commonly claim 
that blockchain could revolutionize  

407
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,480
the global shipping industry and reduce fraud.

408
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
It’s a good claim to interrogate.

409
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,600
First, the things that blockchain is 
capable of tracking are things that  

410
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,320
manufacturers and shippers are already 
tracking, or at least trying to track,  

411
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,880
so this is not so much “revolution” 
as it would be “standardization.”

412
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,440
Even that is built on a predicate assumption 
that everyone picks the same chain.

413
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,160
It’s an extremely optimistic assumption.

414
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,040
Many, many, many firms deliberately want their  

415
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,360
information centralized and obfuscated 
to protect against corporate espionage.

416
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,680
The lack of a shared, standardized 
bucket to put all the information into  

417
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,480
is not because it’s been heretofore 
impossible, but because it’s been undesirable.

418
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,600
Second, it assumes the existence of a theoretical 
mechanism that ensures the synchronization of the  

419
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,800
chain and reality above and beyond the 
current capacity of logistics software,  

420
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,840
some means of preventing people from just  

421
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,360
lying to the blockchain and giving it the 
information it expects to be receiving,  

422
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,640
the blockchain equivalent of ripping off the 
shipping label and slapping it on the new box.

423
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,360
The bigger problem here is 
that in the pantheon of fraud,  

424
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,240
man-in-the-middle attacks 
are actually pretty rare.

425
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,040
Global shipping needs to deal with it in certain 
capacities, but taken on the whole the vast  

426
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,440
majority of fraud doesn’t come from altering 
information as it passes between parties,  

427
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,840
rather from colluding parties 
entering bad information at the start.

428
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,080
Con artists don’t hack the Gibson to transfer 
your funds to their offshore accounts,  

429
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,400
they convince you to give them your password.

430
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,560
Most fraud comes from people who technically 
have permission to be doing what they’re doing.

431
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,200
Rather than preventing these 
actual common types of fraud,  

432
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,440
cryptocurrency has made them absurdly easy, 
and the main reason why cryptocurrency needs  

433
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,360
to be so resistant to man-in-the-middle 
attacks is because the decentralized nature  

434
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,840
of the network otherwise makes them 
acutely vulnerable to those attacks.

435
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,560
What this all kinda means 
is that blockchains are all  

436
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,000
pretty bad at doing most of the things 
they’re trying to do, and a lot of the  

437
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,440
innovations in blockchains are attempts at 
solving problems that blockchains introduced.

438
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,840
The biggest issue that cryptocurrencies have 
suffered from is a lack of tangible things to  

439
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,080
actually use them on as currencies, rent or food 
or transit, and this is for pretty simple reasons.

440
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,400
One is that the transaction fees on popular 
chains are so prohibitive that it’s pointless  

441
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,480
to use them on any transaction that isn’t 
hundreds, if not thousands of dollars;  

442
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,480
no one is going to buy the Bitcoin Bucket from 
their local KFC. Ethereum’s main transaction fee,  

443
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,520
called Gas, on a good day runs around $20 US 
per transaction, but that’s severely optimistic.

444
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,320
As of December 2021 the daily average 
cost of Gas hasn’t gone below $50  

445
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,960
US since August, with the three 
month daily average riding over $130.

446
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,480
And that’s just the daily average.

447
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,880
The hourly price can, and does, swing 
by up to two orders of magnitude.

448
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,159
The throughput of blockchains is 
so abysmal that transaction slots  

449
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,079
are auctioned off to the highest bidder, 
that’s why these numbers are so extreme.

450
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,719
It only takes a few high rollers competing on 
a transaction to drive the hourly price of gas  

451
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,839
up over $1000 US. The internal term for this 
is a “gas war” because it’s just that common.

452
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,280
Bots, in particular, can drive 
gas prices well into the tens  

453
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,400
of thousands of dollars as they 
compete to capitalize on mistakes,  

454
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,480
such as someone listing something for 
sale well below its general market price.

455
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,400
Also, it needs to be stressed: these gas wars 
aren’t localized to just the thing that’s being  

456
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,080
fought over. If Steam is getting hammered because 
ConcernedApe posted Stardew Valley 2 by surprise,  

457
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,760
that will probably stay pretty well 
contained. If Taylor Swift concert  

458
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,000
tickets go on sale and LiveNation gets 
crushed, you might never even know.

459
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,400
What those don’t do is cause 
the cost of placing an order  

460
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,960
on DriveThruRPG to spike by eight 
thousand percent for three hours.

461
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,040
The second big reason is that value on 
the coins themselves is so volatile that  

462
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,400
unless you’re willing to engage with 
the speculative nature of the coins  

463
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,400
there’s actually a huge risk in 
accepting them as payment for anything.

464
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
Bitcoin in particular, owing to its glacial 
transaction times, suffers from problems where  

465
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,760
the value of the coin can change dramatically 
between the start and end of a transaction.

466
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,560
This is such a problem that it’s led to the rise 
of an entire strata of middlemen in the ecosystem,  

467
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,320
so-called “stablecoin” exchanges 
like Tether that exist to quickly  

468
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,160
transfer cryptocurrencies between 
each other and lock-in values.

469
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,960
The stablecoins, rather than 
having a speculative value,  

470
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,520
have a value that’s pegged to the value of an 
actual currency, like the Euro or US dollar.

471
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,360
The underlying problem that they 
exist to solve is itself twofold.

472
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,440
One is that converting cryptocurrency into  

473
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,880
dollars is the step of the process that 
makes you accountable to the tax man,  

474
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,760
and the primary goal of crypto in general is 
to starve public services, so that’s a no go.

475
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,440
The second is that there just 
aren’t actually that many buyers,  

476
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,160
and there’s not enough liquidity in 
the ecosystem to cash out big holdings.

477
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,840
Tether, the largest stablecoin, used 
to advertise itself as being backed  

478
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,920
on a one to one basis back when it was 
called Realcoin, but that language has  

479
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,560
become far more nebulous over time as it’s 
become obvious that it just isn’t true.

480
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,280
This is a very complicated situation, but the 
short version is that the people who own Tether  

481
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,240
also own a real money exchange called Bitfinex, 
and there’s evidence that the two services,  

482
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,320
both which require having actual dollars 
on hand in order to back their products and  

483
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,760
facilitate exchanges, are sharing the same pool 
of money, swapping it back and forth as needed.

484
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,000
This means that at any given time 
either service is potentially backed by  

485
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,240
zero dollars, or at least that’s what 
the data implies might be the case.

486
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,840
Point is that if you’re a high 
roller with tens of millions  

487
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,480
of conceptual dollars tied up in cryptocurrency,  

488
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,040
there’s a fundamental cash problem. Your 
holdings have inflated to tens, hundreds,  

489
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,040
or thousands of times what you put in, but that 
price is just theoretical. It’s speculative.

490
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,480
You have all this crypto, you 
can’t meaningfully spend it,  

491
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,360
and there’s not enough 
buyers for you to get it out.

492
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:39,120
In order for you to cash out you need 
to convince someone else to buy in.

493
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,320
These factors, taken holistically, mean 
that cryptocurrency is a Bigger Fool scam.  

494
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,040
There’s a lot of digital ink spilt trying 
to outline if it’s a decentralized Ponzi  

495
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,080
scheme or a pyramid scheme or some hybrid 
of the two, which is a taxonomical argument  

496
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,880
that I’m not here to settle, but, like 
both of those, it’s a Bigger Fool scam.

497
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,240
The whole thing operates by buying 
worthless assets believing that you  

498
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,360
will later be able to sell them to a bigger fool.

499
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,120
The entire structure of cryptocurrencies 
at their basic level of operation  

500
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,520
is designed to deliver the greatest rewards 
to the earliest adopters, regardless of  

501
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,400
if you’re talking about proof-of-work or 
proof-of-stake. This is inherent to their being.

502
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,080
As Stephen Diel put it

503
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,960
“These schemes around crypto tokens cannot create 
or destroy actual dollars, they can only shift  

504
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,000
them around. If you sell your crypto and make a 
profit in dollars, it’s only because someone else  

505
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,200
bought it at a higher price than you did. And 
then they expect to do the same and so on and  

506
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,360
so on ad infinitum. Every dollar that comes out of 
cryptocurrency needs to come from a later investor  

507
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,080
putting a dollar in. Crypto investments 
cannot be anything but a zero sum game,  

508
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,360
and many are actually massively negative sum. In 
order to presume a crypto investment functions as  

509
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,800
a store of value we simultaneously need to 
suppose an infinite chain of greater fools  

510
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,680
who keep buying these assets at any 
irrational price and into the future forever.”

511
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,880
So with all that out of the way, 
let’s talk about the ape in the room.

512
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,400
♪ NFTs super-sexy, man it always lures me ♪
♪ I’m too focused and you know you’ll never  

513
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,514

516
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,080
NFTs, non-fungible tokens.

517
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,440
On a conceptual level the 
tech acts as a sort of generic  

518
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,280
database to mediate the exchange of digital stuff.

519
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,480
The most optimistic read on it is a framework for 
a type of computer code that creates so-called  

520
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,520
true digital objects, meaning digital 
objects that possess the attributes of both  

521
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,600
physical objects and digital, 
being losslessly-transmittable  

522
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,840
while providing strict uniqueness, 
which is an important concept.

523
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Strict uniqueness is a way of 
saying that two different things  

524
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,880
are different things, even if they’re 
different copies of the same thing.

525
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,520
My copy of Grey by EL James is strictly unique. 
While millions of copies of the book exist,  

526
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,040
this is the only copy that is this copy, 
and this is the only copy that has the  

527
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,120
very specific damage of being glued 
shut and thrown into the Bow River.

528
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
[splash]

529
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,880
It is also strictly scarce. While 
millions of copies of Grey exist,  

530
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,080
that’s still a finite number, 
meaning it is possible,  

531
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,960
though not immediately practical, 
for the world to run out of copies.

532
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,880
NFTs impose a simulacrum of this 
physical scarcity and uniqueness  

533
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,360
onto digital objects within their ecosystem.

534
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
[splash]

535
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,320
On a technical level a non-fungible token 
is just a token that has a unique serial  

536
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,680
number and can’t be subdivided into smaller parts.

537
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,800
Two tokens, even two that tokenize the same  

538
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,440
conceptual thing, are still strictly 
unique with different serial numbers.

539
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,880
Within the context of Ethereum 
and its clones these tokens are  

540
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,520
effectively a small packet of data 
that can contain a payload of code.

541
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,120
It’s a box that you can put a micro program into.

542
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,000
That micro-program is called a smart contract, a 
name that is so comically full of itself that I  

543
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,880
feel like it’s misleading to even call them 
that, but I have to for simplicity's sake.

544
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,960
But real quick, yes, that is how the 
inventors conceptualize the role of  

545
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
these things, as the unity of programming and law.

546
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,920
The phrase “code is law” gets bandied 
about as an aphorism, and it’s just  

547
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,760
so full of holes that we’re going to be 
spending the next forever talking about it.

548
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,080
Before we move into that this is the root of it:  

549
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,440
there is a tremendous disconnect between what NFT 
advocates say they do and what they actually do.

550
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,680
But, and this is very important,  

551
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,280
both the claimed functionality and 
the actual functionality are both bad.

552
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,600
It’s all broken, none of it works well,  

553
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,000
so the idea of it becoming the norm is 
terrible, but the prospect of what the  

554
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,880
world would look like if all the mythologizing 
and over-promising came true also super sucks.

555
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,760
The end goal of this infinite machine 
is the financialization of everything.

556
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,520
Any benefits of digital 
uniqueness end up being a quirk,  

557
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,080
a necessary precondition of turning 
everything into a stock market.

558
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,960
There’s nothing particularly offensive 
underpinning the concept of digital collectibles,  

559
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,760
frameworks and subcultures for 
digital collectibles have existed for  

560
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,760
decades within various contexts, but NFTs  

561
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,400
exist to lend credibility and functionality to 
the cryptocurrencies that they exist on top of.

562
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,040
Okay, okay, okay, code is law.

563
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,080
Now, what that little smart contract 
program does is up to the token creator.

564
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,960
It can be a relatively sophisticated applet that 
allows the user to execute various commands,  

565
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,800
or it can be a plain hypertext link to a 
static URL of an image, or anything in between.

566
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,520
Most are a lot closer to static URLs 
than they are to functional programs.

567
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,040
This is in part because the thing 
that NFTs have become synonymous with  

568
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,920
are digital artworks, but really what 
the token represents is arbitrary.

569
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,280
It can be a video game item, a 
permission slip, a subscription,  

570
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,560
a domain name, a virus that steals all your 
digital stuff, or a combination of all of those.

571
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,640
While the concept has been floating around since 
2015 when the framework was thrown together  

572
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,160
in a day during a hack-a-thon, and the first 
Ethereum implemented tokens were minted in 2017,  

573
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,560
for the mainstream the story starts in the spring 
of 2021 following a string of high-priced sales  

574
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,400
of tokens minted by digital artist Beeple, 
culminating in a $69 million dollar sale  

575
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,360
of a collage of Beeple’s work in March 
via old money auction house Christie’s.

576
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:44,160
This high-profile sale triggered a media 
frenzy and an online gold rush as various  

577
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,760
minor internet celebrities raced to cash in on 
the trend, hoping to be the next to cash out big.

578
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,560
Over the course of about six 
weeks the ecosystem burnt  

579
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,200
through just about every relevant meme possible.

580
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,440
Laina Morris, popularized on Reddit as 
Overly Attached Girlfriend, sold the  

581
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,200
“original screengrab” to Emirati 
music producer Farzin Fardin Fard  

582
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,160
for the equivalent of a little over $400,000 US.

583
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Zoe Roth, aka Disaster Girl,  

584
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,280
sold the original Disaster Girl 
photograph to Fard, for also $400,000.

585
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,960
Kyle Craven sold the original Bad Luck Brian 
photo for $36,000 to anonymous buyer @A.

586
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,200
Nyan Cat sold for almost $600,000 with 
multiple variants also selling for six figures.

587
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,720
Allison Harvard sold Creepy 
Chan I and II for $67,000 and  

588
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,000
$83,000, respectively, also both to Fard.

589
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,960
In addition to these high-profile sales of things 
that were already popular, whale buyers like Fard  

590
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,040
were dropping four and five figure sales 
onto a random assortment of other artworks.

591
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,880
Corporations and individuals auctioned 
off NFTs representing intangible,  

592
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,840
non-transferable concepts, like the 
“first tweet” or “the first text message.”

593
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,160
Cryptocurrency evangelists jumped at 
every opportunity to proselytize this new,  

594
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,160
bold, revolutionary marketplace that 
would free artists from the yoke of  

595
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,840
the gig economy and provide buyers 
with an immutable record of ownership  

596
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,520
of authenticated artworks stored 
on an eternal distributed machine.

597
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,160
You could be holding the next generation’s 
Picasso! Artists could continue to earn  

598
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,760
passive revenue from secondary sales! 
Imagine what it’ll be worth in five years!

599
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,720
This created an air of absolute mania, as it 
seemed like anything could be the golden ticket.

600
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,000
Digital artists, especially those 
working with media like generative  

601
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,240
art that’s difficult to monetize via 
conventional channels like physical prints,  

602
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,400
raced into the space and, on 
the whole, lost a lot of money.

603
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,000
Critics began questioning what it was 
that was actually being bought and sold.

604
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,320
Copyright? Commercial permissions? 
A digital file? Bragging rights?

605
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,480
In a huge number of cases the answer 
wasn’t very clear, and even the sellers,  

606
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,760
caught in the promise of a payday, weren’t 
altogether sure what they had even sold.

607
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,480
Tons of the tokens did little more than point to 
images stored on normal servers readily accessible  

608
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,400
via HTTP, meaning the bought assets would be 
just as vulnerable to link rot as anything else.

609
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,600
Some pointed to images stored on peer-to-peer IPFS 
servers, which are more resistant to link rot as,  

610
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,720
similar to a torrent, it only requires that 
someone keep the file active somewhere,  

611
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,080
rather than requiring the original server to 
stay up, but as millions of dead torrents prove:  

612
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,960
that’s still a far cry from the “eternal” 
storage solution that evangelists were claiming.

613
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,040
The images were stored and delivered the 
same way as any other image on the internet,  

614
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,960
easily saved or duplicated simply 
by virtue of the fact that in order  

615
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,640
for your computer to display an 
image it needs to download it.

616
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,280
Claims of digital scarcity apply only to the 
token itself, not the thing the token signified.

617
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,760
More than that, there was no cryptographic 
relationship between the images and the tokens.

618
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,000
The image associated with a token 
could be easily altered or replaced  

619
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,840
if the person with access to the server that 
the image was hosted on just changed file names,  

620
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,040
making the relationship between the two tenuous 
and flimsy in a way that undermined the claims  

621
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,880
that this was somehow a more durable, 
reliable way of transacting digital art.

622
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,160
There was also no root proof of authenticity, no  

623
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,880
confirmation that the person minting the 
artwork was the person who created the artwork.

624
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,680
This is a pretty handy encapsulation of the 
way that blockchain fails to solve the most  

625
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,160
common problems with fraud, which tend to start 
with bad data going into a system at the input,  

626
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,120
not data being altered mid-stream.

627
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,920
Artists who complained about 
this system which clearly  

628
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,480
incentivized impersonating popular 
artists, including deceased artists,  

629
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,720
were told that it was their fault for 
not jumping in sooner, that if they had  

630
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,160
bought in and minted their stuff first then 
it would be easy to prove the forgeries.

631
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,000
Because evangelists don’t see this as 
a tool, as a market that may or may  

632
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,120
not fit into an artist’s business, they see it as  

633
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,160
the future, so failure to participate isn’t 
a business decision, it’s just a mistake.

634
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,080
They’re terrible people.

635
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,080
All told the frenzy collapsed pretty quickly.

636
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,960
By June the market had 
already receded by about 90%,  

637
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,160
which, incidentally, just further incentivized 
the low-effort process of minting other peoples’  

638
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,280
artwork, to the point that art platform Deviant 
Art implemented an extremely well received feature  

639
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,120
that scans several popular NFT 
marketplaces for matching images.

640
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,480
The output of that is extremely depressing.

641
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,520
Not to labour this point, but reposting 
digital art without attribution is nothing new.

642
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,560
Profiting off someone else's 
art is also nothing new.

643
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,080
All that’s new is NFTs represent 
a high-energy marketplace with an  

644
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,880
irrational pricing culture where the mean buyer is 
easily flattered and not particularly discerning.

645
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,600
The potential payoff is extremely high, much, 
much higher than a bootleg Redbubble store,  

646
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,400
the consequences border nonexistent, and 
the market is clearly in an untenable state,  

647
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,040
so there’s an incentive to get in at as 
low a cost as possible before it collapses,  

648
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,200
hence the absolute plague of art theft.

649
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,840
Even the argument that artists 
could make passive revenue off  

650
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,880
secondary sales turned out to 
have a lot of caveats attached.

651
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,880
One, the smart contract for the token needs 
to have a function that defines royalties,  

652
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,560
so anyone who minted a token based 
off of hype making it sound like an  

653
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,120
inherent function of the system was out of luck.

654
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,800
And, two, the token doesn’t know what a sale 
is and can’t differentiate between being sold  

655
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,920
and being transferred, so it’s actually 
the marketplace that informs the token  

656
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,800
“you’re being sold” and collects the royalties.

657
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,040
End result, royalties are easily bypassed 
simply by using a marketplace that doesn’t  

658
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,560
collect royalties or uses a different 
format of royalty collection that’s  

659
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,040
incompatible with the function the token uses.

660
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,360
While a few sellers, legitimate and otherwise, 
made off with undeniably big paydays,  

661
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,280
hundreds of thousands of artists bought 
in only to find that there wasn’t a new,  

662
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,720
revolutionary, highly trafficked 
audience of digital art collectors.

663
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,120
Instead there was a closed market dealing in 
casino chips where the primary winners were  

664
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,680
those already connected, who already had the means 
to get the attention of the whales and the media,  

665
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,800
a market where participation required buying 
into a cryptocurrency at a rapidly fluctuating  

666
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,440
price in order to pay the minting costs to 
post the work, where it would sit, unsold.

667
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,800
This left those artists in the lurch, 
where they had to choose between just  

668
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,440
eating the losses, or attempting to convince 
their existing audience to buy-in as well.

669
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,680
The people who actually won were the people 
with large holdings of cryptocurrency,  

670
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,240
specifically Ethereum which mediated the 
vast majority of these big ticket purchases.

671
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,120
David Gerrard, author of Attack 
of the 50 Foot Blockchain,  

672
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,160
summarized it on his blog very succinctly as such:

673
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,800
“NFTs are entirely for the benefit of the crypto 
grifters. The only purpose the artists serve  

674
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,560
is as aspiring suckers to pump the 
concept of crypto — and, of course,  

675
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,600
to buy cryptocurrency to pay for ‘minting’ NFTs.  

676
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,360
Sometimes the artist gets some crumbs to 
keep them pumping the concept of crypto.”

677
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,240
The rush benefits them in two ways: first 
the price of Ether itself goes up directly  

678
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,360
from the spike in demand, between January and 
May the price of Ether rose from $700 to $4000,  

679
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,880
and second there’s new actual buyers 
who aren’t just trading Bitcoin for  

680
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,320
tether for ether and back again, 
but are buying in with dollars,  

681
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,120
providing the whole system with the liquidity 
needed for whales to actually cash out.

682
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,840
This arrangement, needing to buy a highly 
volatile coin from people who paid far,  

683
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,680
far less for it in order to participate 
in a market that they control,  

684
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,960
is why people reflexively describe 
the whole arrangement as a scam.

685
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,240
If you buy in at $4000 and compete against 
people who bought in at $4, you’re the sucker.

686
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,320
It reveals the basic truth that these 
aren’t marketplaces, they’re casinos.

687
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,400
And, indeed, even through all the rhetoric  

688
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,480
of “protecting artists” and whatnot was 
the ever-present spectre of the gamble:  

689
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,400
whatever you buy now might be 
worth hundreds of times more later.

690
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,240
Constantly invoked is the opposite 
proposition of the bad deal:  

691
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,600
what if you had been the 
person who bought in at $4?

692
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,120
Let’s take a closer look at that eye 
watering $69 million Beeple sale.

693
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,480
Independent journalist Amy Castor has done an 
enviable job running down the details here in  

694
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,560
her piece “Metakovan, the mystery Beeple art 
buyer, and his NFT/DeFi scheme“ but to summarize  

695
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,560
the long and short of her notes, the buyer is 
a crypto entrepreneur named Vignesh Sundaresan  

696
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,120
who purchased the piece to boost the reputation 
and value of his own crypto investment scheme  

697
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:19,760
Metapurse and Metapurse’s own token B.20, 
which Beeple owns 2% of the total supply of.

698
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,240
Following the Christie's sale the reported 
value of B.20 went from 36¢ per token to $23.

699
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,600
And that’s just the anatomy of a single sale.

700
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:35,040
The very obvious conclusion observers reached 
was that none of this is about the art at all,  

701
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,400
but the speculative value; 
not what it’s worth to you,  

702
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,840
but what it’ll potentially be worth 
in the future to someone else.

703
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,160
It’s not a market, it’s a casino, gambling on the 
receipt for an image or video that’s otherwise  

704
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,840
infinitely digitally replicable.

705
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,720
The thing itself is immaterial as 
long as it can make a line go up.

706
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,720
This is the essence of the market, 
and a microcosm of what evangelists  

707
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,440
imagine they want to see as the future, 
the financialization of everything.

708
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,800
The frenzied market around old Reddit 
memes was doomed from the start.  

709
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,440
There’s a finite supply of meaningful 
originals, so to keep this thing going,  

710
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,040
to keep the line going up, you need something 
more, something less tied to anything specific.

711
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
--

712
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,920
In the months since the initial 
craze the marketplace had mutated.

713
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,680
The It Thing was no longer memes or 
digital works from established artists,  

714
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,960
but character profiles from large, procedurally 
generated collections with names like CryptoPunks,  

715
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,040
Bored Ape Yacht Club, Lazy Lions, 
Cool Cats, Ether Gals, Gator World,  

716
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,680
Baby Llama Club, Magic Mushroom Club, 
Rogue Society Bot, and Crypto Chicks.

717
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,200
These were notable for, again, commanding utterly 
irrational prices seemingly completely decoupled  

718
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,440
from any legitimate or legal transaction, 
and being generally extremely fugly.

719
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,600
This surge generated an immediately 
adversarial relationship between the buyers,  

720
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,440
who touted them as both evidence 
of their extravagant wealth and  

721
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,200
their foresight into the future of digital 
economies, and pretty much everyone else.

722
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,160
A very common response to anyone using one of 
these profile pics, or bragging about their  

723
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,840
purchase, became saving and reposting the image 
in reply, or even changing profile pics to match.

724
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,760
Spurred by a speculative tweet from 
Twitter developers suggesting that  

725
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,400
they were working on an NFT verification 
system, Twitter users broadly rallied at the  

726
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,480
opportunity to immediately identify 
people that it was okay to bully.

727
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,720
Tweets from within the cryptosphere started 
leaking out, things like Santiago Santos  

728
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,840
tweeting things like “NFTs = Identity 2.0. Can’t 
remember the last time I used my pic on the left.”

729
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,800
Emphasis on physical traits. Genetic 
lottery. Prone to bias and prejudice.

730
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,240
Identity by choice. Unique and digitally 
scarce. Representation of values and beliefs.

731
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,840
Of course what Santiago was leaving out was 
that he had paid the equivalent of $171,000  

732
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:09,520
US for that profile pic, which probably gives him 
some incentive to really commit to it as something  

733
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,520
interesting and special, even 
though, stripped to the studs,  

734
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,080
literally all he was describing was using a 
non-representational image as a profile pic.

735
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:26,240
For about six years my profile pic on the Dungeons 
and Dragons forums was a stock photo of a cabbage.

736
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,800
So, not really breaking new ground here.

737
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,880
Greg Isenberg sat at his computer and 
decided to bang out “most people who  

738
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,600
make fun of NFTs
- Own zero NFTs 

739
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,520
- Have never minted an NFT
- Have never participated in a community 

740
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,840
- Have never staked their NFT
- Haven’t built on-top of an NFT project 

741
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,520
- Have never earned an NFT playing a game
- Missed out on BAYC, Punks, Cool Cats etc.”

742
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,320
A chain of logic implying that skeptics of 
the market are just uninformed sore losers.

743
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,760
Incidents like these lent to the very 
accurate perception that the loudest  

744
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,440
voices in NFTs weren’t very familiar 
with internet culture as a whole,  

745
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,720
weren’t terribly smart in general, and were by and 
large coming at all this from the financial side,  

746
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,920
further supported by all of them having “tweets 
are not investment advice” in their twitter bios.

747
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:22,160
In short the same people 
who made and bought Juicero.

748
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,080
It also laid bare that the 
conversations were inherently suspect.

749
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,000
How can you ever trust the sincerity 
of someone telling you how awesome  

750
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,360
their $171,000 investment is when your 
persuasion stands to directly benefit them  

751
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,120
by potentially driving up the value 
of their investment portfolio?

752
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:48,480
You’ve gotta be extremely rich for 
$171,000 to not be an extremely sunk cost,  

753
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,760
and that’s absolutely going to weigh on your 
mind and influence how you see the market.

754
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,600
So for my part I tweeted about several 
of these incidents and was, in response,  

755
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,920
hounded for days by annoying people with 
NFT profile pics who insisted that I  

756
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,680
just didn’t get it, I wasn’t seeing the community.

757
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,760
So I decided to go see the community.

758
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,360
My experiment started with the Cool Cats 
Discord, one of the communities that I’d  

759
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:16,400
been assured was top of the pile. I 
joined, read back through days and  

760
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,400
days of conversation logs, watched the active 
conversations, and was generally unimpressed.

761
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,160
It was, at best, unremarkable.

762
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,560
A primary concern was still rooted 
in the monetary value of the tokens.

763
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,760
“If you spend 1 million on a cat, 
it’s not just for Twitter and no  

764
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,880
one would be happy seeing someone 
mint another one later for free.  

765
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,840
That’s why punks are at 120 Eth… 
symbols… memes… theres’ the value.”

766
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,720
What wasn’t unremarkable is the 
way that I was immediately deluged  

767
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,760
by bots sending me invites to other Discords.

768
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,760
So, between the spam I was receiving 
and the Cool Cats’ dedicated “shill”  

769
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,400
channel I came up with an idea.

770
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,360
♪ Rap crypto, y’all know Bitcoin ♪
♪ I want to thank y’all for checking  

771
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,600

772
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,611

773
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:11,880
♪ Follow me as I go Rambo ♪
♪ To the moon in my brand new Lambo ♪

774
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:17,760
For days now I’ve been accepting every 
spam NFT Discord invite I've received,  

775
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,200
and it's getting dire.

776
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,960
Stoner Cats, Oni Ronin, Magic Mushroom Club, 
NFTITS, The Humanoids, EtherGals, Cool Cats, Senzu  

777
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,320
Seeds, Pro Camel Riders, Long Ween Club, Stick 
Humans, Bumping Uglies, World of Wojak, GenMAP,  

778
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:36,720
DIMEZ, MagicMarblesNFT, Beverly Hills Car Club, 
Cash Cows, Long Neck Cartel, Pug Force, HoodPunks,  

779
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,480
Gorilla Club, Alien Archives, Betting Buddahs, 
Fighter Turtles Club, The Iconimals, Basement  

780
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,720
Dwellers, Wizard Man Jenkins, KATI, METAMONZ, 
CrazySkullz, BoxGang, Gym Punks, Unc0vered,  

781
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,200
Nitropunk, Crypto Bowls, Masquerade Massacre, 
Cat Colony, SkelFtees, Daffy Panda Ganging Up,  

782
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,600
Betting Kongs, Wolves of Wall Street, The Llama 
Farm, Happy Sharks, Teacup Pigs, Cool Llamas,  

783
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,160
Mad Carrot Gang, Barnyard Fashionistas, 
Sol Cities, Oink Club, Outlaw Punks,  

784
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,880
Crypto Astronuts, NFT Worlds, Panda 
Paradise, Time Travellers, CyberKongz,  

785
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,600
Party Ape Billionaire club, J Corps, 
KwyptoKados, MetaBirds, and that’s about  

786
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,640
as far as I got before more or less giving 
up and finally shutting off Discord DMs.

787
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,320
Now, this is a fraction of a fraction 
of what’s out there, but I do think  

788
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,640
it’s a pretty representative 
sample, and I learned a lot.

789
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,560
For example, the basic psychological 
profile of the average buyer is someone  

790
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,360
who is tenuously middle class, socially 
isolated, and highly responsive to memes.

791
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:40,080
They are someone who has very little experience 
with real businesses and production processes,  

792
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,880
thus are unlikely to be turned off by 
unrealistic claims about future returns.

793
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,600
They are insecure about their lack of knowledge,  

794
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,440
and this makes them very susceptible to 
flattery, in particular being reassured  

795
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,120
that the only reason for negativity is 
because critics just don’t understand.

796
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,680
Being tenuously middle class gives them 
enough disposable income to engage with  

797
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,600
a pretty expensive system, but also a very 
potent anxiety about their financial future.

798
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,080
It goes without saying that 
they’re fixated on money,  

799
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,080
and they principally understand the 
technology as a means of making money.

800
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,600
Criticism of the system is typically met 
with confusion. Don’t you want to make money?

801
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,560
I also learned a lot about fraud, and how 
to do it both on purpose and by accident.

802
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,600
The term “rug pull” with its derivations “rug” and 
“rugged”, all to describe projects that made big  

803
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,880
promises but then took the money and ran, embedded 
themselves in my vocabulary extremely quickly.

804
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,320
The market is just absolutely 
lousy with fraud and deception.

805
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,080
Wash trading, where you sell something 
to your own sockpuppets in order to lure  

806
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,440
in a real buyer who thinks they’re 
getting a good deal, is rampant.

807
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Market manipulation is so common and 
accepted that it’s actually considered bad  

808
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,560
form if project leaders don’t actively engage 
in it, like it’s considered disrespectful  

809
01:00:54,560 --> 01:01:00,080
to the buyers if the project leaders 
don’t help inflate the resale price.

810
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,000
Also, and I really should not leave 
this merely implied, the art is bad,  

811
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,240
but not in any sort of interesting way.

812
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,640
It’s bad in a smoothed over copycat way,  

813
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,080
a low effort garbage dump from artists who have 
largely given up on having ideas or opinions.

814
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,640
Derivative, lazy, ugly, hollow, and boring.

815
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,320
The capacity for original thought long having 
been drained out of the illustrators kept in  

816
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,080
the employ and proximity of people who 
refuse to shut up about cryptocurrency,  

817
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,120
there is an overwhelming tendency to fall 
back on stale memes and self-flattery.

818
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:34,480
A massive volume of cryptocurrency art ends 
up being art about cryptocurrency, transparent  

819
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,760
pandering to an audience that is either deeply 
stupid or easily pleased and quite possibly both.

820
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,200
Absent any artistic insight, the vacuum 
is instead filled to overflowing with  

821
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,960
references to doge memes, Bitcoin, 
ethereum, stonks, to the moon,  

822
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,760
buy the dip, good morning, and desperate 
pleas for sempai Elon Musk to notice them,  

823
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,680
all presented with the earnestness and 
authenticity of a Pickle Rick bong.

824
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,960
It's tempting to say that my 
approach, accepting every spam invite,  

825
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,840
was a really flawed way to delve deeper, 
that "obviously" accepting invites from  

826
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,280
spam bots would mainly lead me into less 
stable projects, but surprisingly no.

827
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,440
I got just as much spam for successful 
projects like Humanoids and NFT Worlds  

828
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,640
as I did for rug-pulls like 
Crypto Astronuts and Hood Punks.

829
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,080
On the whole, if you just look at the 
pitch package and the sample product,  

830
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,560
there's very little material difference between 
a project that's gonna sell out 10,000 tokens  

831
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,800
in six hours and one that's going to become a 
trash fire as the project leader has a nervous  

832
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,200
breakdown and burns the mint three days 
post-launch after only selling 800 tokens.

833
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,120
Party Ape Billionaire Club sold 
out, bringing in about $3.2 million,  

834
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,400
and are now flexing their wealth by 
partnering with other crypto projects  

835
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,080
like the 2chains-produced NFT cartoon 
show The Red Ape Family, which just  

836
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,720
really, truly shows off the community’s 
deep pockets and commitment to quality.

837
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,960
[humming noise]

838
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,600
Deep in their roadmap is the promise that 
they will start production on an MMORPG,  

839
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,480
a claim that buyers are entirely faithful in.

840
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:09,840
Crypto Astronuts sold 1262 of their 9485 tokens, 
bringing in an impressive $375,000. But as nice as  

841
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,018
that number is, it’s not remotely enough to even 
start proceeding with their plan to build a full  

842
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:19,440
scale PvP-based MMO. Following the failed mint 
in October the devs slowly went quiet and then,  

843
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,200
bit by bit, websites, social media accounts, and 
eventually the Discord itself all disappeared.

844
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,960
Based off the ostensible product, why should 
one of these succeed and the other fail?

845
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,600
The key distinction, ultimately, between a Party 
Ape Billionaire Club and a Crypto Astronuts  

846
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,400
is that PABC was already flush with cash and 
able to manufacture hype with high-priced  

847
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,560
giveaways and expensive advertising. 
Buying advertising space in Times Square,  

848
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,880
in particular, is a specific fixation.

849
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,600
But running a 10 second ad 
every eight minutes on one  

850
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,760
out of the way billboard in Times Square 
isn’t effective advertising, not externally.

851
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,400
All it’s really good for is internal propaganda,  

852
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,040
making insiders feel like the money that 
they’ve spent is buying credibility.

853
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,720
And if you’re in a speculative bubble, 
betting that someone down the line will  

854
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,680
buy you out for more than you bought in, 
credibility is worth everything in the world.

855
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,040
This is pervasive.

856
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,840
Even in the most established projects, ones that 
have been going for years, there's not really an  

857
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:27,520
underlying thing, these aren't fandoms in the 
way you would experience them around a game  

858
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,840
or a TV show or a book, the product is pretty 
insubstantial if not functionally non-existent.

859
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,160
This is where these projects diverge significantly  

860
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,360
from the artworks that drove the 
speculative mania in the spring.

861
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,280
They’re not positioning themselves as 
art that is worth possessing for the art,  

862
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,600
as flimsy and illusory as that claim was, 
but as ongoing projects that you buy into.

863
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:54,560
The purchase of a token is an abstracted 
version of buying early stock in a company,  

864
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,480
a venture-capital style investment in 
promises, which is a very significant mutation.

865
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,240
Okay, so what do these phantom 
companies claim to exist to do?

866
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,120
Pretty much all of them promise direct 
financial returns in some way shape or form.

867
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,560
Sometimes this is just a nebulous 
sense that the whole thing will go  

868
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,960
“to the moon”, meaning the value of the tokens 
will take off and thus early buyers will be able  

869
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,000
to resell for huge profits, or more direct as 
the project leaders promise the formation of,  

870
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,520
effectively, an unofficial hedge fund investing 
a communal pool into other crypto products.

871
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,280
Probably the funniest of all of these was 
Betting Kongs, which wanted to create an  

872
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,720
unregulated real money casino 
in which token holders would be,  

873
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:40,560
explicitly, part owners, and also permitted 
to gamble in the casino that they owned.

874
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:46,480
“Betting Kongs is not your ordinary NFT 
project, we aim to create passive income  

875
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,520
for our NFT owners by co-owning 
a casino with a profit split.”

876
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,440
“Welcome to the whitepaper fellow gamblers!”

877
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,720
“Why are we doing this? To put it short, 
we love gambling and noticed how a lot  

878
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:06,080
of the operators out there are owned by large 
corporations who have no care for the community  

879
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:11,520
of the service they provide… We want to 
provide a project where everyone playing  

880
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,920
can be a co-owner of the place they’re 
playing at and make money from it all.”

881
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,680
Failure was probably the best outcome for 
everyone, here, if we’re being honest.

882
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,440
Some promise this in the form of 
a more conventional media project,  

883
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,680
like a comic book or a cartoon 
or a movie, or all of the above.

884
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:37,120
“We have planned the creation of a series 
of comics dedicated to the pixel girl”

885
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:43,840
“The key image is static, or at least we think so 
now. But the squeaky girl is still a seductress so  

886
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:50,720
the image of breasts will be presented in various 
variations that our community will approve.”

887
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:58,880
“Let’s imagine, there are 5,000 NFTITs holders. 
There is a 30 million market of comics lovers in  

888
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:06,720
the US… On average every comics lover spends 
around 20 USD per comic per week. It means  

889
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:15,120
80$ per month and 960$ per year. The total 
addressable market is worth 28,800,000,000  

890
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:28,400
USD. Let’s imagine that we take 1% 
of this market. It’s 288,000,000 USD  

891
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:37,840
per year on the base of monthly subscriptions 
raised in crypto. This is a cash flow.”

892
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,320
“Nice to see some active communication, 
and appreciate the effort (as announced  

893
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,320
this afternoon) trying to resurrect 
this project into something successful…  

894
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:46,880
The proposed path forward announced this afternoon 
is intriguing and am prepared to support. The only  

895
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,960
thing I would also like to see, assuming the 
project can be successfully turned around  

896
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,440
is to perhaps, in addition to some revenue 
sharing, have some revenue donated to Breast  

897
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,240
Cancer Research. To truly enjoy them, 
we should keep them happy and healthy!”

898
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:06,080
As already implied, many of them promise video 
games, often an MMO, but just as often, like,  

899
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,320
just the concept of a video game?

900
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,280
Okay, wait, let me word that another way.

901
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,680
They will promise “a video game”.

902
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:21,200
Like, that’s the promise, in its entirety. 
No clues for genre, style, scope, engine,  

903
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,240
or platform or how any of the tokens would 
interact with it. Just “a video game.” If  

904
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:33,920
we sell 10,000 tokens for $300 each we will start 
brainstorming development ideas for a video game.

905
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,840
Now, all of these tend to be in collections 
of ten thousand, and there’s actually an  

906
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,000
interesting sort of quirk inside that.

907
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,840
The initial format was to mint an  

908
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,120
entire collection and just 
shove them out onto the market.

909
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,800
The cap comes into play purely 
because you have to tell the program  

910
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,439
generating the garbage when to stop.

911
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:55,279
However as the scheme started to 
take off and competition rose,  

912
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,679
it became obvious that this was a sucker’s 
way of doing it because that meant paying gas  

913
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,000
fees on everything up front, plus 
the gas fees on the actual sale.

914
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So someone came up with a system for 
minting a random output on demand which  

915
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,960
shuffles the mint cost off onto the buyer.

916
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,600
From there it all took off like wildfire.

917
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,080
Very low up-front cost, extremely low 
risk, plus it turns the entire system  

918
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,680
into a gacha game with different 
rarity curves for attributes.

919
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:24,800
At best these are all obfuscated 
gambling schemes, at worst active scams.

920
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:31,520
And the payoff of failure makes it extremely 
difficult to parse one from the other.

921
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,360
World of Wojak only sold 20 tokens to 
11 people and still pocketed over $5000.

922
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:44,319
Pro Camel Riders sold 114 tokens 
to 71 buyers and took home $25,000.

923
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:53,919
METAMONZ sold 722 of their 9999 tokens to 
343 buyers and walked off with $211,000.

924
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:03,120
Since the average buy-in is over $350, the payday 
for failure makes it irrational to succeed.

925
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,960
The interesting aspect of it all, 
though, is the emergent fiction of it.

926
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,120
These smoke vendors don’t have an actual 
product more complex than the output of  

927
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:16,640
a vending machine in the front of a grocery 
store, so they need a story to sell instead,  

928
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,440
and so we get this wave of poorly defined 
projects pitching a token with an attached  

929
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,680
jpg that represents the concept of a 
thing that could become a future business.

930
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:30,080
What that business does is unimportant, 
and indeed many of these projects,  

931
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:35,120
successful and otherwise, trade in a 
flattering myth of decentralization  

932
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,040
where the direction of the business, 
down to its fundamental product,  

933
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:44,880
is shunted into the indeterminate future to 
be decided later by collective consensus.

934
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,960
Are we a comic book, a movie, a hedge fund, a 
casino, or a bimonthly curated box of snacks?  

935
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,840
Well that’s for the token holders to decide.

936
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,080
All that matters is that whatever 
it is, it will definitely  

937
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,800
make the value of your tokens go up, 
so you should definitely buy two.

938
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:08,720
“One thing I learned about NFTs, if you think 
something’s going to be a blue chip, you should  

939
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,640
definitely buy at least two, because you’re going 
to get one, emotionally attached to one of them  

940
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,360
and you’re not going to want to sell it, because 
NFTs are going to explode all over the world.

941
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,880
And if you’ve got a blue chip today it’s going 
to be incredibly more valuable in five years  

942
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,640
from now, or even three years from now, or 
even two years from now, than it is today.”

943
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,640
On the front of otherwise respectable, or 
at least established, brands and people  

944
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,200
getting into NFTs the results tend to 
be extremely tepid and insubstantial,  

945
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:41,520
even by the standards of NFTs; very low-risk, 
low-quality, low-engagement tokens shoveled out  

946
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,920
the door to capitalize on a hot buzzword, 
chasing the cash that’s sloshing around.

947
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,440
[Drumming]

948
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,720
Tied up in all this, there's an 
extremely pervasive resistance to  

949
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,520
any form of skepticism that ultimately 
manifests as a sort of toxic positivity.

950
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,400
This is all part of a complex feedback loop.

951
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,960
The projects, broadly speaking, lack any 
kind of substantial product, existing almost  

952
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,640
entirely as promises backed by nothing more than 
a screenshot of a roadmap and some sample PFPs.

953
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,800
And, again, I think it's really important to keep  

954
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,640
in mind that that goes for successful 
projects just as much as for rug-pulls.

955
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,680
There really isn't any meaningful 
difference between a Party Ape  

956
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,600
Billionaire Club and a Betting Kongs.

957
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,480
Betting Kongs were never going to make a casino, 
even if they hadn't tanked, and despite the fact  

958
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:34,000
that they were running billboards in Time 
Square PABC is never making an MMORPG.

959
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,880
Both claims are equally ridiculous, but 
one of the two made a huge pile of money.

960
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,680
The primary product is ultimately hype, 
which is both insubstantial and fickle.

961
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,400
Negativity, both internal and external, can 
have a meaningful impact on the willingness  

962
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:53,600
of people to buy into a project, and if buyers 
are tepid then you won't get a runaway sale,  

963
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,000
and if you don't get a runaway sale then 
that's going to turn off buyers even more,  

964
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,240
which means the secondary market for 
tokens will likely fail to materialize.

965
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,760
This is what makes enthusiasts 
so deeply unreliable.

966
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,280
They have meaningful financial 
stake in an intangible, volatile  

967
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,160
thing that exists entirely 
as a collective ideoform,  

968
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:17,600
a story about a potential future outcome, whose 
value is based entirely on public perception.

969
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,840
You can’t trust what they have to say because 
they’re currently holding a hot potato,  

970
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,800
and as much as they insist that they just really,  

971
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,080
really enjoy the feeling of a 
burning hot potato in their hands,

972
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,680
do they?

973
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,760
Or are they just hoping that you’ll catch it?

974
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,640
This creates an environment of 
toxic positivity where doubt  

975
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,960
is aggressively policed by both project leaders,

976
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,440
who have an obvious financial interest in hype 
since their big payday is the minting rush,

977
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,240
and community members themselves, who have 
a speculative financial interest in hype.

978
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,880
While all of that is logical in the pure sense 
that there's an effect that can be explained by  

979
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,520
an incentive, the output is effectively 
a self-organizing high-control group.

980
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,240
Doubters are ostracized so aggressively  

981
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,400
that it chills all conversation 
about a project's actual viability.

982
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,880
All concerns are just FUD: 
fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

983
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,560
Questions that would be utterly 
banal in any other investment forum,  

984
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,200
what has the team done, what assets do they have,  

985
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:18,320
why should anyone believe they can deliver 
on their promises, are treated as hostile.

986
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,680
And the frank reality is 
because there aren't answers.

987
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,280
Party Ape Billionaire Club is 
just as vaporous, and yet they  

988
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:31,440
superficially succeeded, so there's 
incentive to enforce the collective illusion.

989
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,280
This is multiplied by an internal 
form of performative etiquette.

990
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,720
Participants ritualistically wish each 
other good morning and good night,  

991
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,200
boiled down to the shorthand GM and GN.

992
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:46,240
That seems like a small thing, there’s nothing 
inherently suspicious about good morning or  

993
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:52,480
good night, but in observed practice it’s a very 
distinct ritual, not merely a shibboleth, but a  

994
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:58,800
repetitive action that signals in-group membership 
and affirms loyalty on an ongoing basis.

995
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,720
If you have Diamond Hands it means 
you’re willing to Hold a token until  

996
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:08,000
some promised future where the value goes To 
the Moon, you’re not a Paper Hands loser who  

997
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,640
is easily spooked by instability, volatility, 
or the fact that there’s no reason to believe  

998
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,640
that anyone is ever going to want to 
buy a Crypto Astronut in the future.

999
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:22,720
The shorthand WAGMI, We’re All Going To Make It, 
is aphoristically bandied about even in openly  

1000
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:28,960
zero-sum competitions where, by definition, 
most participants explicitly won’t make it.

1001
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,480
But you can’t point that out, 
because that would be FUD.

1002
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,400
And if you’re spreading FUD then 
you’re NGMI, Not Going to Make It.

1003
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,840
And making it, getting rich, is all that matters.

1004
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,720
HFSP, have fun staying poor.

1005
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:49,440
These are synthesized into a No True Scotsman 
paradigm. The “we” in We’re All Going To Make It  

1006
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,600
does not refer to we all, it refers to the select, 
the chosen, the Diamond Hands and the hodlers.

1007
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,560
Those who make it are clearly the We, and 
if you didn’t make it, then you weren’t.

1008
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,480
People who get angry about being 
scammed by a rug-pull or by  

1009
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,840
malware or by social engineering are berated 
and belittled for not following the crowd.

1010
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,240
This incubates a community trained to 
ignore warning signs and dismiss criticism,  

1011
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,640
a community with internal 
language and customs that  

1012
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,000
are explicitly incompatible 
with outside communications.

1013
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,920
Skepticism is FUD from non-believers 
who are trying to undermine the value  

1014
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,080
of your assets and manipulate a crash 
or trick you into being a paper hands.

1015
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,760
It all maps onto narratives of sin and deception,  

1016
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,000
a chosen-few who are privileged with 
advance knowledge about the promised land,  

1017
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,640
which they can achieve by holding strong 
to the rituals and expelling all doubt.

1018
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,560
The end product is a 
self-organizing high-control group.

1019
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,040
And the results of that are obvious: there 
are still people convinced that somehow  

1020
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,240
someone is going to pick up 
the ashes of Evolved Apes  

1021
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:57,040
and manifest the rest of the project, a 
belief based on no observable evidence.

1022
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,520
“You like to ban, you like to ban people, 
right, you like to ban people from your  

1023
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,520
Twitch stream, huh? All you’re doing 
is shitting on Decentraland, bro.  

1024
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,160
I’m sorry you don’t like to make 
money here in the network, but, uh,  

1025
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,560
I wanted to talk on your Twitch stream, man 
I probably could have brought a lot of people  

1026
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,240
on there, and all you want to do is talk shit 
and ban people, man you banned me instantly.”

1027
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,600
So the question, then, is what 
do the tokens actually do?

1028
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:29,040
As mentioned before the token itself is just 
a box that a bit of data can be put into.

1029
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,040
Now, this box is extremely small,  

1030
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,600
to the point that even an average cell phone 
photograph is several times too large to fit.

1031
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,280
Due to the nature of the chain,  

1032
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,920
updating software that’s put onto the 
chain is both difficult and expensive.

1033
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,520
Complicated programs need to be 
broken up into multiple tokens each  

1034
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,800
containing a smart contract that 
defines a portion of the whole,  

1035
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,320
and all of these contracts need to 
interlink and reference each other,

1036
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:58,560
but with an eye towards the fact that 
each transaction that either computes or  

1037
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:05,280
alters information requires paying processing 
fees, only reading information is free.

1038
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,080
The process of fixing a bug in a smart contract 
basically amounts to minting a new copy of the  

1039
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,120
contract and then jumping through some hoops 
to re-name the old and new contract so that  

1040
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,520
the new copy has the name that any other 
interacting contracts are looking for,  

1041
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,280
paying fees for just about 
every step of that process.

1042
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,680
This creates a very funny Catch 22 where 
on one hand is the insistence that the  

1043
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:32,880
NFTs that end users buy are potentially 
extremely powerful, able to be miniature  

1044
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,480
self-governing applets that exist in a 
web of like applets, and on the other hand  

1045
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:43,120
is a large stack of incentives to 
put as little into them as possible.

1046
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,840
For an example of the pitfalls, Wolf Game 
was a somewhat popular NFT based gambling  

1047
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,640
game that bragged about being hosted 
entirely on-chain, at great expense.  

1048
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:57,600
Everything from the pixel art wolves and sheep 
to the game’s code was stored on Ethereum.

1049
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:03,200
The idea behind the game is that users would mint 
a character token, which had a 90% chance of being  

1050
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,800
a sheep, and a 10% chance of being a wolf, with 
a finite supply of wolves and sheep available.

1051
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:14,320
The important thing here is that the character 
tokens weren’t just a bit of art and a serial  

1052
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,680
number, but tiny programs that allowed 
users to perform interactions like staking.

1053
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,400
The problem is that their code was full of 
multiple bugs, and since some of those bugs  

1054
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:32,480
were contained in the character tokens, they 
were replicated across all 13,809 minted tokens.

1055
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,560
A glitchy token can’t be 
patched, it must be replaced.

1056
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:43,280
So the Wolf Game devs were forced to 
not only re-deploy all their contracts,  

1057
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:50,000
but attempt to re-mint and distribute 
identical copies of every token generated.

1058
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,200
It didn’t go well.

1059
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,840
Given the risks inherent in putting 
functionality inside the token itself,  

1060
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,280
and the high cost of interaction, 
the most common application  

1061
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,320
is to use external systems to simply 
check for possession of a token.

1062
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:09,840
This is where we introduce another player into 
the ecosystem: wallet managers like MetaMask.

1063
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,640
In a few short years the system has already 
grown so bloated and difficult to interact with  

1064
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,200
that it’s become necessary to develop middleware  

1065
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,560
applications that simplify the 
process of generating wallets,  

1066
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,440
switching wallets, and mediating handshakes 
between the wallet and external systems.

1067
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,760
From one point of view these wallet managers 
are the golden key that makes it all work.

1068
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,120
They solve the single-sign on problem allowing 
your web browser to simply know that it’s  

1069
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,920
you who is using it, automatically negotiating 
permissions based on relevant tokens.

1070
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,720
It’s your log in, your credit card, your Steam 
profile, and your bank account all rolled into  

1071
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:51,520
a single point of contact making interaction with 
Web3, the internet of the future, frictionless.

1072
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,240
From another point of view it’s a massive point 
of failure that contains so much information,  

1073
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,800
so many permissions, so much of worth, that it 
becomes an extremely obvious point of attack,  

1074
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,800
manufactured by idiots who claim to 
be building a security product in 2021  

1075
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,840
that doesn’t obfuscate key phrases within 
the UI or use two factor authentication.

1076
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,440
Remember, again, that these people want 
to put medical records, drivers licenses,  

1077
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,480
professional accreditations, and 
real estate deeds into their system.

1078
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,840
They should not be trusted.

1079
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,400
The entire market is absolutely lousy with scams,  

1080
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,120
and has been since Bitcoin 
first gained any traction.

1081
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,000
Every single scam structure imaginable has been 
dusted off and redeployed into this explicitly  

1082
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,520
unregulated market where victims 
are largely without recourse.

1083
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,360
These range from institutional scams, 
like Ponzi schemes, pump and dumps,  

1084
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,680
and insider trading, to middle-weight 
scams like gold brick and wash trading,  

1085
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,520
to grittier scams like phishing 
and sending fake links.

1086
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,520
Pump and dumps, in particular, are conducted 
in broad daylight, since it’s not illegal,  

1087
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,120
it’s just against the terms of service 
of the exchanges that you use to do it,  

1088
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,920
so the worst case scenario 
is you burn your account.

1089
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,120
They’ll straight up walk you through 
the process of doing a pump and dump,  

1090
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,440
no codewords, diagrams and everything.

1091
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,120
They’re notable as they’re actually 
a two-headed scam because, you see,  

1092
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,040
you might get recruited onto 
the pump half of the scheme,  

1093
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,080
or you might think you’re being recruited 
to pump, but you’re actually the dump.

1094
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,720
As already mentioned, blockchain is resilient to 
direct man-in-the-middle attacks, where someone  

1095
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:21,920
tries to inject bad data straight into the 
chain, but man in the middle attacks are rare.

1096
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,240
In an environment like cryptocurrency, 
with few, if any, repercussions for  

1097
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:32,080
misbehaviour that stays within the cryptosphere, 
man-in-the-middle attacks are wholly unnecessary.

1098
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,960
Why try to brute force your bad data onto 
the chain when you can trick someone into  

1099
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,640
giving you access to their wallet, 
then transfer all their stuff out?

1100
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:44,000
Every smart contract becomes a 
self-rewarding bug bounty where  

1101
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,480
the payout is whatever apes and coins 
you can grab before anyone notices.

1102
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,880
And that’s not even touching 
on the subject of malware!

1103
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,280
Smart contracts are just code, they’re software,  

1104
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,880
there’s no reason they can’t be viruses or worms, 
the primary limitation is processing power.

1105
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,560
But, also, it’s a virus that someone can drop  

1106
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,440
directly into your bankless bank account 
and just wait for you to activate it.

1107
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,000
And, yeah, that’s right, there’s no 
offer/confirmation step in sending  

1108
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,720
tokens back and forth, someone who knows your 
wallet can just drop stuff right into it,

1109
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:20,000
so, like, pin that somewhere in your brain.

1110
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,480
The best part about this is that the whole 
ecosystem operates on a strict assumption that  

1111
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,480
possession is ownership and access is permission,

1112
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,960
which is absolutely buckwild coming from software  

1113
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,000
developers who claim to be very 
concerned with systems security.

1114
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,240
If someone tricks you into sending 
them your Bored Ape it’s now theirs.

1115
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,680
The only mechanism in the machine 
for parsing legitimate transactions  

1116
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,800
from illegitimate transactions 
is the consensus mechanism,

1117
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:50,080
which is only concerned with whether or not the 
transactions followed the rules of the software.

1118
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,280
The only illegitimacy it recognizes 
are people trying to insert fake data.

1119
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,840
When you are tricked into doing something  

1120
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:03,360
all of the mechanics of what follows are, 
by the rules of the system, legitimate.

1121
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,800
It’s a legal transfer.

1122
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,320
More relevant, however, is the 
sheer density of these scams.

1123
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:13,040
The one market that cryptocurrency has 
successfully disrupted is the market of fraud.

1124
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,200
Think of this this way: a big population of 
people have willingly self-identified that  

1125
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:22,000
they have substantial disposable income, 
poor judgment, low social literacy,  

1126
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,240
a high tolerance for nonsensical 
risk, and are highly persuadable.

1127
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,160
People who fall victim to these scams 
have basically no options other than  

1128
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,320
taking to social media and attempting to 
whip up enough of a frenzy that they can  

1129
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:40,000
convince marketplaces like OpenSea to act as 
de facto censors by delisting stolen tokens.

1130
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,720
There’s no authority you can report them to 
that has the power to return your tokens,  

1131
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:51,280
the best you can hope for is denying the scammers 
profit on their incredibly low-cost operation.

1132
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,240
If your business is tricking 
people out of their money  

1133
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,920
you would be a fool if you 
didn’t take the opportunity.

1134
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,560
Not only have participants advertised their 
susceptibility to incoherent promises of  

1135
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,680
future returns, the immutable structure of the 
chain, the persistence of data, and the ease  

1136
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:14,880
with which that data can be collated, means that 
for scammers it’s extremely easy to find marks.

1137
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,960
Every Discord for a rugpull NFT project is 
a roster of potential victims. The ledger  

1138
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,600
of BAYC holders is a shopping list of 
targets. The twitter account of anyone  

1139
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:32,160
complaining about what they lost on Evolved Apes 
is the low hanging fruit of a very ripe orchard.

1140
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:40,120
And that’s a pretty good segue 
into talking about privacy issues!

1141
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,120
[Drumming]

1142
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,480
A low trust environment is 
also a low privacy environment.

1143
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,520
Anything you do on a blockchain is, by design,  

1144
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,800
accessible to everyone who 
knows how to navigate the data.

1145
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,280
Now, you might be thinking, isn’t that 
the opposite of how it’s supposed to work?

1146
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,680
I thought crypto was all anonymous?

1147
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:06,320
So, yes, crypto is anonymous by default, there’s 
no inherent requirement for proof of identity,  

1148
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,480
and in fact numerous applications 
that would benefit from a stricter  

1149
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,960
1-to-1 correlation between accounts 
and people struggle with this.

1150
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,920
On forums and social media 
it’s called sockpuppeting,  

1151
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,760
in crypto it’s called a Sibyl attack, 
where users are able to generate  

1152
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,600
numerous alternate identities by 
creating additional accounts or wallets.

1153
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,560
The epidemic of wash trading on OpenSea 
relies on the ability to pretend you’re  

1154
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:36,160
several different people as you buy apes from 
yourself for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1155
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,960
Rather than anonymous this is pseudonymous.

1156
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,280
Everyone can see what wallets and 
contracts your wallet interacts with  

1157
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,640
based off the long hash addresses like this,  

1158
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:52,880
but that hash is only implicitly connected to 
your identity based on circumstantial connections.

1159
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,320
Of course a big circumstantial 
connection would be something like  

1160
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:00,800
registering with a crypto-based social auction 
platform that intrinsically connects the two.

1161
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,880
This makes it pretty easy to see that 
Laina Morris, Overly Attached Girlfriend,  

1162
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,840
paid $153 on March 31st to mint 
the Overly Attached Girlfriend NFT,  

1163
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,200
followed by a $205 reserve on April 
2nd to list the NFT on Foundation.

1164
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:20,640
Ethereum whale Farzin Fardin Fard then bought 
the token on April 3rd for 200 Ethereum,  

1165
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:25,280
30 of which went to Foundation, with 
Laina getting the remaining 170,  

1166
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:30,880
which she transferred into USD using the 
exchange service Kraken in a block of 105  

1167
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:40,480
on April 4th and a block of 65 on April 22nd 
for a combined total payout of $374,726.

1168
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:46,000
After her sale Zoe Roth transferred 
the Ethereum to dollars via Coinbase  

1169
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,360
the next day and hasn’t touched the wallet since.

1170
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:55,680
Kyle craven minted several… other… tokens, but 
for the most part just split the Ethereum from  

1171
01:27:55,680 --> 01:28:00,240
the initial sale into two separate holding 
wallets where it’s sat untouched since.

1172
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,760
You don’t need to be some super 
hacker to figure this stuff out,  

1173
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,720
it’s all publicly available, that’s 
the entire point of the system.

1174
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,440
And in another feature-not-bug arrangement,  

1175
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:16,160
remember nothing can be deleted from the 
blockchain without tremendous effort.

1176
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:21,840
Now, that’s fine if the blockchain only contains 
a contextually relevant log of transactions,  

1177
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,960
there are absolutely contexts where that level 
of transparency is desirable, but that falls  

1178
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,840
apart when you start talking about using the 
blockchain itself as the storage medium for,  

1179
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,640
like, an entire social network.

1180
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,920
Blockchain-based social network Scuttlebutt 
seems tacitly aware that this is a bad idea,  

1181
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,960
like somewhere inside their human brains they 
recognize that it might be a mistake to make it  

1182
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,280
impossible to remove things from the system 
when they warn users that anyone willing to  

1183
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:56,240
dig can surface any old usernames, photos, and 
bios, but that doesn’t actually give them pause.

1184
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:01,680
So, if someone posts, say, child abuse 
imagery, revenge porn, your home address,  

1185
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:05,760
intimate details of your private life, there’s 
just nothing you can really do about that.

1186
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,160
If you mistakenly over-share, post some 
information that maybe you shouldn’t have,  

1187
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,000
it’s already too late.

1188
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,040
You can try to hide it, but you can’t delete it.

1189
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:20,000
Remember that if someone knows your wallet 
address they can just put tokens directly into it?

1190
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,560
As alluded there’s a whole scam where you 
drop someone an NFT that lifts the art from  

1191
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,080
who cares, somewhere, but the smart contract is 
malicious code that drains their wallet if they  

1192
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,360
ever interact with it to 
move it, sell it, stake it,  

1193
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:37,440
burn it, it just becomes a landmine 
sitting in their wallet forever.

1194
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,600
“Yo, this is fake, this is fake, this is fake, 
this is fake, they popped up in my wallet,  

1195
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:47,200
I clicked on it to delete it, immediately they 
stole 19 grand. Happily I just started this  

1196
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,520
wallet, but already they stole 19 thousand 
out of it. Need fuckin’ help immediately.”

1197
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,480
Even on the non-malware side of 
things people have already been  

1198
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,800
using this to dump promotional tokens into 
the wallets of celebrities and influencers,  

1199
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,120
but, you know dick pics are an “any 
second now” kinda thing, right?

1200
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,920
“Oh, look, I minted a photo of your front door 
and dropped it directly into your wallet.”

1201
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,520
And you can’t just, like,  

1202
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,760
delete it, you need to actively send it 
somewhere, and pay gas fees to do so.

1203
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,160
Revolutionary new vectors of harassment.

1204
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,960
The end product here is a massive power imbalance  

1205
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,560
that’s baked into the fabric of how 
you engage with this new world order.

1206
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,440
Users who engage with the system authentically 
as themselves expose vast swathes of information  

1207
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:31,520
about themselves and their activities, 
while users who engage disingenuously  

1208
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,120
are empowered in their ability to 
deceive, defraud, and disappear.

1209
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,360
A lot of this rhetoric stems from a pretty deep 
failure to understand what a central authority  

1210
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,400
really is, or that you can decentralize 
data storage while centralizing data.

1211
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:49,040
Ethereum is ultimately a central platform, 
and the fact that a few dozen people need to  

1212
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:54,160
sign off on every major change before it can be 
implemented is largely meaningless and symbolic,  

1213
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,880
with the validation network ultimately sitting 
somewhere between consortium and cartel.

1214
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:03,040
Every large platform has multiple 
internal and external stakeholders  

1215
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,920
that form a consensus about 
the direction of the platform.

1216
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,640
Windows is not a single-minded monolith.

1217
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,880
Apple issues voting shares.

1218
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,360
Google is basically a hydra.

1219
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:17,840
While the network of Ethereum miners and 
validators are not a formal corporation

1220
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,120
Yet

1221
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:23,120
There’s no mechanism in existence that 
compels them to act in the interest of users,  

1222
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,400
particularly poor and disempowered users, 
where those interests conflict with their own.

1223
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,960
The movement of Ethereum from proof of 
work to proof of stake has been vapourware  

1224
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,520
in no small part because the 
validators simply choose not to.

1225
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:42,160
Because proof of work, volatility, and high 
gas fees benefit them in the here and now,  

1226
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:46,960
while proof of stake and low gas fees only 
benefit them in a hypothetical future.

1227
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,560
Because these extremely obvious 
pitfalls are what you get when  

1228
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,960
you let guys like Vitalik Buterin 
and Elon Musk design the future.

1229
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,200
The sole protection for users of Ethereum 
is that the system is so cumbersome  

1230
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,480
that all but the most egregious 
breeches aren’t worth addressing.

1231
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:07,840
Of course that, in truth, means that only the 
wealthy have access to justice within the system.

1232
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,600
If you take all these different things, 
all these parts of your identity,  

1233
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,680
all your economic activity, all the video 
games you play, all the groups you join,  

1234
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:19,600
and stick them into one system, 
that’s a central system.

1235
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,520
It doesn't matter how many different 
servers that system spans or how many  

1236
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:30,160
validators need to agree before changes can be 
made, you’ve pooled all that data in one place.

1237
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:36,480
The proposed web3, crypto-driven future 
of the internet is a privacy disaster.

1238
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,440
This is why I find MetaMask 
horrifying as a product.

1239
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,360
It’s a bucket that’s asking you to  

1240
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,480
pour unfathomable amounts of 
data and permissions into it.

1241
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,160
It is such a tremendous and 
monumental point of failure.

1242
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:53,840
And this is where NFTs really 
bloom into their final form.

1243
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,200
[Drumming]

1244
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:03,680
The primary use case of tokens beyond speculation, 
ultimately, is to function as access passes.

1245
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:08,480
From a web engineering perspective imagine tokens 
that are the mother of all cookies and consider a  

1246
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,240
tracking token that users don’t just willingly 
associate themselves with but enthusiastically  

1247
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:20,480
drag with them from device to device ensuring a 
continuity of tracking across all web activity.

1248
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,000
The future version of the web,  

1249
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,280
built on the back of cryptocurrency and 
mediated by financialized tokens, is a dystopia.

1250
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,080
It’s a technology that’s built 
to turn everything into money,  

1251
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,440
to treat every corner of our 
social existence as a marketplace,  

1252
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,720
to attach an abstract, representative token to 
everything from video games to labour unions.

1253
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,440
Now, proponents of Web3 will 
disagree with this assessment,  

1254
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:46,880
particularly the claim that cryptocurrency is 
endemic to Web3 and the two are intractable,  

1255
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,240
but that’s the practical reality of the situation.

1256
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:54,000
Every substantial project branding 
itself under the banner of Web3 is  

1257
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,840
strapped to the side of a blockchain, 
be it issuing governance tokens,  

1258
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,400
or relying on the chain’s smart contract layer, 
or requiring possession of a cryptocurrency in  

1259
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:06,000
order to pay the processing fees that 
are mandatory in order to participate.

1260
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,240
They are at this point philosophically 
and technologically entwined.

1261
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:14,960
Less accessible, less free, less interesting, 
and substantially more expensive,  

1262
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:20,880
Web3 is the vanguard of a million paywalls and 
oppressive "code enforced" DRM schemes sold to  

1263
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:25,520
idealists as a decentralized system where they, 
and not wealthy stakeholders, have the power.

1264
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,840
I see tremendous blind spots in a community 
that has spent so long focusing on the hype of  

1265
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:35,040
an untenable fantasy Metaverse where they're the 
ones cowing corporations with immutable ownership  

1266
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:40,240
guaranteeing their ability to resell video game 
horse armour that they've failed to consider  

1267
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:44,960
that the "enforcement of ownership" 
can and will be used against them  

1268
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,720
if and when corporations decide to 
leverage their power in the space.

1269
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,640
The fantasy amongst evangelists is that 
a tokenized economy where digital goods  

1270
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,320
are mediated by NFTs would give 
them more power, that goods like  

1271
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:00,560
digital games would have true ownership, 
encapsulated in the ability to be resold,  

1272
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,400
but there is no reason to believe that 
this is how things would shake out.

1273
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,640
The far, far more probable result 
is that the tokens are used to lock  

1274
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,800
products down even tighter.

1275
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,680
The Squid Game token scam is illustrative here.

1276
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:19,600
In early November, 2021, a new meme token popped 
up, styled after the hit Netflix show Squid Game.

1277
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,600
Over the course of about a week the price of the  

1278
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,000
token was pumped from a few 
cents to just under $3000 US.

1279
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,960
Estimates are that the Squid developers 
took in about $3.38 million dollars  

1280
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,360
before cashing out their holdings, deleting 
their socials, and vanishing into thin air.

1281
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,760
A classic rug pull, but the 
truly transcendental detail  

1282
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:46,080
is that it left buyers with not merely a useless 
token, but a token that couldn’t be sold at all.

1283
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,720
Built into SQUID was a requirement that 
in order to transfer or sell the tokens  

1284
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:56,320
a corresponding number of MARBLES tokens 
needed to be spent at the same time.  

1285
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,120
The hitch was that MARBLES were never available.

1286
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:05,440
No rules were broken in this scam, and indeed the 
SQUID tokens do exactly what they say they do.

1287
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,240
If you have the appropriate 
amount of MARBLES tokens  

1288
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,840
you can absolutely transfer or sell your SQUID.

1289
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,240
Just, good luck getting any.

1290
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:20,080
A game developer can in any of myriad ways 
deliver on a “truly owned” digital token  

1291
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,880
that is rendered untradeable in practice, 
and all by playing by the rules.

1292
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,360
Rules must always be evaluated 
for their power to oppress.

1293
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:34,320
This is a blind spot to crypto enthusiasts because 
they just assume that they’re the early adopters,  

1294
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,920
they’re the ones who will have power, they’re 
the ones who will get to set the rules,  

1295
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,320
and they’re the ones who will do the oppressing.

1296
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:45,520
Consider that any token that can be used to 
grant access can also be used to revoke it.

1297
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,320
Like, let’s say that I create a hangout spot 
in one of the Metaverse contender platforms,  

1298
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:54,240
Decentraland, and we call 
it the Ahegao Alpaca Oasis.

1299
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:58,320
The Oasis has a back room that only 
allows registered players to enter,  

1300
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,120
meaning you need to have your metamask 
linked to Decentraland in order to get in.

1301
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:08,800
This type of gate is typically used to create 
VIP areas, places where only people who hold a  

1302
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:14,800
specific token or class of token can enter. 
Only people with official Ahegao Alpacas  

1303
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:21,360
can enter. But, as is well known, within the 
lore of the Metaverse the Ahegao Alpacas have  

1304
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,800
long been at war with the Bored Ape Yacht Club, 
so rather than checking for an Alpaca token,  

1305
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,080
I check for Ape tokens, and then forbid entrance.

1306
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,280
Or maybe I just make my game artificially 
more difficult for them, or inflate my prices.

1307
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,480
Now imagine that instead of running 
a hangout spot in a video game,  

1308
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,840
that I’m a Decentralized Finance organization 
giving out mortgages in cryptocurrency and I scour  

1309
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:49,040
your transaction history for donations to the 
NAACP as part of my “risk assessment protocol”.

1310
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,720
Imagine that Nestle is able to track 
unionization efforts in real time  

1311
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:56,640
because the union is issuing governance 
tokens on a publicly auditable blockchain.

1312
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:02,000
The belief that the world will be fairer if 
the rules are enshrined in code, enforced by  

1313
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:07,600
computers, and made extremely difficult 
to change or circumvent is laughable.

1314
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,120
It’s not merely naive, but 
categorically ahistoric.

1315
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,520
This is where a lot of my resistance comes from.

1316
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,000
You can create specialized crypto chains 
that have a negligible environmental impact,  

1317
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,760
but the force of that model 
is culturally destructive.

1318
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:26,000
The current system sucks, but this is just 
a worse version of the current system.

1319
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,120
It doesn’t even stop there. 
It’s tokens all the way down.

1320
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:34,400
“This game it has a, a good, a high barrier 
of entry, so most people can’t do it unless  

1321
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,760
they have what’s called a scholarship where 
someone essentially pays for their barrier  

1322
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,760
of entry to allow them to play the game and 
then they can split the profits afterwards.”

1323
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,960
Like, okay, Axie Infinity is a so-called 
“play to earn” video game based on Ethereum,  

1324
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:52,400
but because Ethereum is too slow and expensive to 
interact with directly the developers, Sky Mavis,  

1325
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:58,480
created a side-chain called Ronin, which consists 
of a governance currency called AXS, the game  

1326
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:04,240
character tokens called Axies, and the in-game 
currency called Smooth Love Potions, or SLP.

1327
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,960
All of these components are 
built to function as money,  

1328
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,200
because that’s what the machine is built to do.

1329
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:12,000
The so-called play-to-earn model is a great case  

1330
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,240
study in what the end result of the 
crypto ecosystem actually looks like.

1331
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:20,720
Axie Infinity gets a lot of credulous coverage 
from the press because a handful of people in the  

1332
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:25,440
Philippines are able to make a marginal living 
by playing the game and flipping their SLP,

1333
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:30,000
which lets Sky Maven turn around and pretend 
that they’re a humanitarian organization  

1334
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,840
and not a for-profit business who makes 
money off all the people rushing to buy  

1335
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,880
a team of Axies believing they 
can get paid just for playing.

1336
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,800
Now, real quick, Axie Infinity is 
a lightweight card-based PvP game  

1337
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,680
where players fight with a team 
of three critters called Axies.

1338
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,400
It’s a bit Pokemon and a bit Slay the Spire.

1339
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,280
Axis have randomized attributes 
and are all tokenized,  

1340
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:53,040
so if you sell an Axie you’re 
selling that specific Axie.

1341
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,920
Smooth Love Potions are used to breed Axies and 
thus form the basis of the economy as they are  

1342
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,640
fungible relative to the Axies themselves.

1343
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,480
Matches are either ranked or unranked,  

1344
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:07,520
but only ranked matches, entered using energy 
which recharges every day, can earn SLP.

1345
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,320
The amount of energy you have to 
work with depends on the number  

1346
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:14,000
of axies in your wallet, and ranges from 20 to 60.

1347
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,600
Additionally higher ranked 
matches are worth more SLP.

1348
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,000
More SLP means a bigger stable of Axies,  

1349
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,600
which means more energy to play matches, 
more flexibility within the metagame,  

1350
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:28,160
better team compositions, and baseline 
better stats, enabling easier wins.

1351
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,960
So the difference in earning 
potential between higher and  

1352
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,680
lower ranked accounts is pretty substantial.

1353
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:38,000
What coverage tends to note and then 
quickly move on from is the fact that the  

1354
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,120
game is extremely expensive to onboard, costing 
hundreds of dollars to assemble a basic team,  

1355
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:47,520
which has led to the rise of what are 
euphemistically called scholarship programs:

1356
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,280
businesses like Whale Scholars that 
set up a large number of accounts,  

1357
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,440
give players access to the game 
account but not the underlying wallet,  

1358
01:40:55,440 --> 01:41:00,000
and then pay players a split of 
the SLP the account generates.

1359
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,720
Whale Scholars, and other “mentorship” businesses,  

1360
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:08,560
retain full control of the wallet, and 
thus the Axies, the SLP, and any AXS.

1361
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,880
It’s capitalism in its rawest form.

1362
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:16,160
Players invest their time into grinding SLP, 
and then the owners take half the returns.

1363
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,400
Players get to barely make minimum wage 
while the owners, who are taking 50%  

1364
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:25,200
from dozens, if not hundreds of players, 
get to speculate on digital land.

1365
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:36,240
“Look what the Whale Scholars just got. We have 
land in the arctic baby! We have arctic land!”

1366
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,000
Axie’s energy system is fundamentally broken in 
how it promotes this exact middleman arrangement.

1367
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,720
If you have 21 Axies in your wallet you 
can create one account that has 60 energy  

1368
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:52,320
at its disposal, or you can create seven 
bare-minimum accounts with 20 energy each.

1369
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:57,600
A high-ranked account with 60 energy will 
dramatically out-perform a single low ranked  

1370
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:03,280
account with 20 energy, but seven accounts 
that are played daily by other people is far  

1371
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:09,120
and away the best ROI because it involves doing 
basically nothing except collecting your cut.

1372
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,760
Even more illustrative, between August and October  

1373
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,440
2021 the internal economy 
of Axie Infinity crashed.

1374
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:20,560
Not absolute rock bottom, but bad enough that 
all but the highest ranking players, fell below  

1375
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:26,400
the average daily wage in the Philippines, with 
low ranked players falling below minimum wage.

1376
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,640
Naavik, a think tank and consulting firm 
that does deep research on game economies,  

1377
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,080
has done a pretty deep and thorough 
analysis of the Axie economy  

1378
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:38,000
and in their write up they identify 
the core source is psychological:

1379
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,480
players aren’t playing to play the 
game, they’re playing to make money,

1380
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:48,080
they treat the game as a job and thus have 
little interest in game items for their own sake.

1381
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:54,400
Once they have enough stuff to cover their job 
they stop reinvesting and start cashing out.

1382
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,200
The price of low-quality axies, the ones that new  

1383
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,200
players are likely to buy in order to 
onboard for the lowest cost possible,  

1384
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:06,880
is propped up entirely by players buying them 
roughly at the same rate as they’re generated.

1385
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,680
This requires either mentors to be scaling 
up their teams by buying axies instead of  

1386
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:17,120
generating them, or new players injecting 
new money into the ecosystem by onboarding.

1387
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:21,760
But the more players that are playing, the 
more SLP and axies that will be generated,  

1388
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,760
thus the fundamentally unsustainable 
economic model where an infinite supply  

1389
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,720
of new players must enter the ecosystem 
forever purely to keep the price stable.

1390
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:36,320
If it tips one way or the other you either 
get runaway inflation or runaway deflation.

1391
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:41,040
This happens all the time in games, 
games bork their internal economy  

1392
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,720
constantly, it just doesn’t normally 
matter because you’re talking about  

1393
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:48,320
completely fictional gold, 
or gems, or dragon bones.

1394
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:53,280
A truly stable economy isn’t even desirable 
from a gameplay standpoint, anyway.

1395
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,640
Gentle inflation ends up helping newer and 
more casual players by driving down the  

1396
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:04,160
costs of things in the in-game economy which 
lets those players participate and have fun.

1397
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,720
Of course if your pitch is “play to 
earn” and not “play to have fun”,  

1398
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:13,600
where the optics buoying up the ficitive 
valuation of your company rest entirely on the  

1399
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,720
assumption that players can earn, then that’s 
a bit of a different incentive set, isn’t it?

1400
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,760
More people play Axie Infinity to try and make 
money than play it because it’s a game they enjoy.

1401
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,240
This is a fundamental flaw in the model.

1402
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,080
If you pitch your game based on earning 
potential, you are going to attract people  

1403
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:36,480
seeking to industrialize your platform faster 
and in greater numbers than would otherwise play.

1404
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:40,000
This is exactly the parasitic 
situation that games for decades  

1405
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,880
now have been actively minimizing because 
it creates vicious negative externalities.

1406
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,880
If players can sell their in-game stuff 
then it changes the way they play the game,  

1407
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,720
it changes they way they optimize their playtime.

1408
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:56,320
Since the vast majority of games 
are openly a non-investment,  

1409
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,720
a straight exchange of money for entertainment,

1410
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,960
also known as a “purchase”,

1411
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:05,520
players tend to optimize their play time for 
intangible returns like fun, distraction,  

1412
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,960
socialization, relaxation, challenge, achievement, 
and narrative fulfillment, with absolutely  

1413
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:15,840
no expectation that the money and time put in 
should return anything other than those things.

1414
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,480
The key shift here, and the meaningless 
buzzphrase that you’ll encounter online,  

1415
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,640
is the proposition that the results of 
playing a game should “retain value”,  

1416
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,760
which is code for having a 
potentially speculative price.

1417
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,840
In order to try and keep the grift 
mill running for another few months  

1418
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:36,960
Sky Maven have tweaked the economy to reduce 
the amount of SLP players can earn per hour.

1419
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:42,560
It is a nightmarishly thin edge to be walking on, 
and the main thing it has managed to accomplish  

1420
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:48,960
is enabling an entire strata of pit bosses running 
teams of players grinding out Smooth Love Potions.

1421
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,880
And, like all bosses, they have 
not taken the downturn in stride,  

1422
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,200
and have instead started cracking the whip.

1423
01:45:55,200 --> 01:46:00,000
“We do not accept mediocre gaming 
anymore. Need at least 120-150  

1424
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,200
SLP a day, and those who yield more will 
be rewarded with additional percentage.  

1425
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,960
I prioritize those who have gaming experience, 
we have a separate program for charity.”

1426
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,560
Evangelists like to point to this 
as though it’s inspiring, people in  

1427
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:19,440
economically disempowered countries able to make 
a meagre living by simply playing a video game.

1428
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,080
I reject that framing. It’s horrifying.

1429
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,520
Our global system is so fundamentally 
unjust that people are patting themselves  

1430
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,360
on the back for generating a whole new 
kind of online UwU pit boss who tells  

1431
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,600
you to grind harder or you’re fired 
but caps it off with blushy emoji.

1432
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,200
Oopsie, wooks wike somewun 
didn’t meet theiwr qwota.

1433
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,840
This sucks.

01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,703

1435
01:46:41,703 --> 01:46:45,363

1436
01:46:45,363 --> 01:46:46,960
♪ love ♪
To the moon!

1437
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:51,600
I think the thing that normies don't get 
about NFT bros is their dedication, the  

1438
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:56,240
staggering volume of capital they already 
control, and how deeply rooted they are in  

1439
01:46:56,240 --> 01:47:00,160
the culture of the people who operate 
the platforms we all use every day,  

1440
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,680
and that alone is a good reason 
for people to pay attention.

1441
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:08,880
They have a lot of money and a lot of clout 
that they can use to try and make Fetch happen.

1442
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,760
This is something of the 
splitting point. Basically  

1443
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,640
the future shakes out in one of two broad ways.

1444
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:19,280
One is that some new technological buzzword 
comes along and “blockchain” and “web3” lose  

1445
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:22,800
their sway over investors, the 
stream of new buyers dries up,  

1446
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,800
and the early investors cash out as 
best they can, popping the whole bubble.

1447
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,720
The other is that they’re successful, 
and cryptocurrency is able to crowbar  

1448
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,680
its way into enough corners of our 
lives that it becomes unavoidable,

1449
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:37,280
we’re all forced in some way 
to maintain a crypto wallet  

1450
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:42,400
to manage whatever coins and tokens become 
necessary for participation in society,

1451
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,480
providing early investors with a captive 
audience and steady flow of capital.

1452
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:51,520
To quote German sociotechnologist Jürgen 
Geuter, better known by his online alias Tante

1453
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,520
“There are parts of your digital life 
that currently you can’t really sell,  

1454
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:00,720
but that’s what they want to change. Everything 
needs to be bought and sold, everything is just a  

1455
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:06,400
vehicle for more speculation. The reason they want 
you to be able to resell your access token to some  

1456
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:11,120
service (instead of buying or renting it like 
today) is to create even more markets for  

1457
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:16,720
speculation and the smart contracts can be set 
up in a way that at every corner they profit.”

1458
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,680
The claims that this technology 
facilitates an immutable ledger  

1459
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:25,280
of ownership is itself largely hollow 
posturing, even from within the ecosystem.

1460
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:30,480
Remember that most of the actual things being 
referenced are not contained within the chains  

1461
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,400
themselves, because the chains are too 
slow, restrictive, and bad at their job  

1462
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:40,320
to actually store media, and because many of 
the things being sold are purely ephemeral.

1463
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:46,160
The IPFS address for any given media token can be 
effortlessly minted onto another competing chain,  

1464
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:49,760
or even the same chain. That’s not 
even right-click saving, that’s  

1465
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,000
referencing the exact same media.

1466
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,320
Why is the token on Ethereum more authoritative 
than the token on Tezos or Cardano or Solana or  

1467
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,600
Ergo or Celo or Binance or Alogorand or Polkadot  

1468
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,400
or Eos or Tron or VeChain or Ethereum 
Classic or Fantom or Stellar or Stacks  

1469
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,840
or Neo or Waves or Holo or LINK or Radix or 
Harmony or Oasis or ICON or Secret or IOTA or  

1470
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,240
Crown or TERA or Omni or Enigma or Elastos 
or Edgeware or Bytom or Fuse or Gather?

1471
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:21,200
If a chain hard-forks, which version 
of your stuff is the real one?

1472
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:27,600
Bitcoin is, itself, mired in a turf war 
between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV.

1473
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:33,360
The myth of immutable ownership governed by these 
systems is predicated on a monolithic victor.

1474
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:38,720
In reality your NFTs within the Ethereum 
ecosystem are ultimately just as trapped,  

1475
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:42,880
sandboxed, and meaningless 
as your Steam trading cards.

1476
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,760
You’ll hear about protocols like Polygon that 
aim to let you move stuff from chain to chain,  

1477
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,360
but that’s sleight of hand.

1478
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:54,160
You can’t remove something from a chain, so 
all they really do is create a new token at  

1479
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:58,400
the destination and add a note to the 
bottom of the original token that says  

1480
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,440
“I’m currently somewhere else, 
please don’t move or sell me.”

1481
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:06,000
It’s an ask that’s governed by smart 
contracts, so vulnerable to bad coding.

1482
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,960
In video game terms they would be immediately 
hammered looking for item duplication glitches,  

1483
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:15,520
a vulnerability that’s basically 
inevitable in a mass adoption scenario.

1484
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,040
It’s a system that is at once  

1485
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:22,640
impenetrable and brittle, and that arrangement 
disproportionately empowers the dishonest.

1486
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:27,040
One of the complications is that it’s basically 
impossible to extricate the digital scarcity  

1487
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:32,800
concepts of NFTs from cryptocurrency and the core 
philosophies that cryptocurrency was built from.

1488
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,720
One rose out of the other and they 
are basically forever entwined.

1489
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:41,040
One of the ironies of all this is that 
any legitimate artistic or anti-capitalist  

1490
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:45,680
uses of the underlying technology are 
contingent on the tech remaining niche.

1491
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:49,280
On a very basic level, the systems just suck,  

1492
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,200
being slow, difficult to use, and 
generally oblique. For the most part,  

1493
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:58,320
to the degree that they’re usable at all, it is 
largely at the mercy of only having a few users.

1494
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,240
There are blockchains that are reasonably 
responsive and reasonably cheap,  

1495
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,920
because they’re not popular.

1496
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,440
Hic Et Nunc is a well regarded art market on the 
Tezos blockchain. Transaction fees and deflation  

1497
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:14,160
are, at the moment, relatively minimal and thus a 
lot of the transactions are able to operate in the  

1498
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:20,560
range of five to twenty dollars, but that state 
exists by the grace of being 45th in popularity,  

1499
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:26,000
just high enough to actually have users, but 
not high enough to have attracted too many bots.

1500
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,080
If Tezos goes, as they say, to 
the moon, then that all changes.  

1501
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,480
Users adopt the platform disproportionate to 
the scale of validators, the value of of Tez  

1502
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:39,360
skyrockets, and the actual marketplace of people 
using Hic Et Nunc experience hyperdeflation,  

1503
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,880
where currency hoarders are rewarded 
handsomely and buyers are punished.

1504
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:47,440
Okay, we need to pause here for a moment, 
because this is actually really important,  

1505
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:52,400
but absurdly complex, like textbook-length 
subject matter, so here’s the short version.

1506
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:55,280
Deflation is counter-intuitive 
because the line is going up,  

1507
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,000
which makes it look like a good 
thing, but it’s only good if you  

1508
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,240
already have the currency in hand. As the 
purchasing power of a currency increases,  

1509
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:06,640
typically because cash gets more scarce, 
the cost of goods and labour goes down.

1510
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,040
A deflationary economy punishes buying things,  

1511
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,640
as anything that you buy today will 
inevitably be cheaper to buy in the future.

1512
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:17,680
If you need to buy things that aren’t financial 
assets, things that don’t appreciate in value,  

1513
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:22,160
like food, clothing, rent, vehicles, 
transit fare, you screw yourself over.

1514
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:27,680
This is hyperdeflation, and it’s not only 
designed into cryptocurrencies with their  

1515
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:32,800
hard cap on total coin supply, but considered 
desirable by their creators and evangelists.  

1516
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,920
This is what going “to the moon” means.

1517
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,320
Now let’s talk about unions.

1518
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,040
Using tokens to verify union membership 
and participate in union activities  

1519
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:47,040
relies on the tech being oblique enough 
that union busters and their clients  

1520
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,840
don’t see it as a meaningful arena to monitor.

1521
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,080
Also that ship has already sailed.

1522
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:55,360
Union busters and gig economy evangelists love  

1523
01:52:55,360 --> 01:53:00,080
crypto, they love DeFi, they love 
smart contracts, and they love NFTs.

1524
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,280
And why wouldn’t they?

1525
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,360
It’s an environment that demolishes consumer  

1526
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:07,360
protections and transfers tremendous 
amounts of explicit power to the wealthy.

1527
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:11,600
In a lot of ways this is all just a system for 
deferring trust onto machines and pretending  

1528
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:16,640
that there aren’t humans on the other end, and if 
there’s one thing that union busters love it’s the  

1529
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:23,200
prospect of an unbreakable individual contract 
whose inequities can all be blamed on a machine.

1530
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:24,480
The current state of the web,  

1531
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:29,360
concentrated in a few mega platforms, 
is the result of compounding complexity.

1532
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:34,640
We used to have a web where anyone could learn 
to write a webpage in HTML in an afternoon.

1533
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:38,640
It’s just writing text and then 
using tags to format the text.

1534
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:43,520
But over time people, understandably, 
wanted the web to do more, to look better,  

1535
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:49,360
and so the things that were possible expanded 
via scripting languages that allowed for dynamic,  

1536
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,880
interactive content.

1537
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:56,400
Soon the definition of what a “website” was and 
looked like sailed out of reach of casual users,  

1538
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:00,720
and eventually even out of reach of 
all but the most dedicated hobbyists.

1539
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:04,320
It became the domain of 
specialists. So casual users,  

1540
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,280
excluded by complexity, moved to 
templates, services, and platforms.

1541
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,840
This process gradually concentrated a critical  

1542
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,920
mass of users into a handful 
of social media platforms.

1543
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,360
Already, even within the space, 
new hegemons are forming.

1544
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,760
Tremendous amounts of capital and power are 
concentrating in corporations like Consensys,  

1545
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:29,040
who own MetaMask, and Animoca Brands, who have 
wide and deep investment in crypto gaming.

1546
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:33,760
OpenSea, the at present dominant marketplace 
for tokens on a couple different chains,  

1547
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,480
is filling the power roles users need.

1548
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:40,320
While the chain itself is, in theory, 
the arbiter of truth, nothing prevents  

1549
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:46,320
people from filling the chain with lies, and so 
arises a demand for not merely a chain parser,  

1550
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:51,680
a service that enables users to interact with 
the chain, but an interpreter of the chain.

1551
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,440
Motivational speaker and easy 
mark Calvin Baccera claimed to  

1552
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:59,680
have lost three Bored Ape Yacht Club 
tokens to a social engineering scam.

1553
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:04,400
In reaction to this he took to Twitter to whip 
up a mob that could pressure OpenSea and two  

1554
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:09,440
other marketplaces into flagging the tokens 
as stolen and blocking them from being sold.

1555
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:14,320
Calvin was eventually able to resecure his 
tokens by paying a ransom, because that’s  

1556
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,080
really all you can do and he doesn’t seem 
to consider that from the perspective  

1557
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,600
of the thieves that’s an 
entirely desirable outcome.

1558
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,840
They won. Their plan worked.

1559
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,920
This happens all the time.

1560
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,360
Bored Ape members are particularly 
susceptible targets of fraud owing  

1561
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:33,280
to their specific combination of 
greed and low social literacy.

1562
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:38,160
Looking to avoid paying platform fees and 
royalties many of them moved off OpenSea to doing  

1563
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:43,200
transactions on a shady little platform called 
NFT Trader, which allowed scammers to run a very  

1564
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:48,640
simple link swap scam and steal at least a dozen 
different ape tokens in the span of a couple days.

1565
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,960
The meat of Calvin’s incident is the way in which  

1566
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:55,040
the platforms that interact with the 
chain are being deputized by users  

1567
01:55:55,040 --> 01:56:02,880
to be the de facto authority not on what 
the chain says, but what the chain means.

1568
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:13,840
It is just a recreation of existing power 
structures within the new environment.

1569
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:15,280
[Drumming]

1570
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,960
This is where evangelists insist 
that the answer lies in DAOs,  

1571
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:24,640
decentralized autonomous organizations, a 
“revolutionary” new way to organize people,  

1572
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:28,240
that will allow for the decentralized 
governance of these systems.

1573
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:33,360
So that’s the claim, but what is it, 
exactly, once you strip off the paint?

1574
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,160
A DAO is an organization whose membership, roles,  

1575
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:40,640
and privileges are governed by possession 
of relevant tokens on a given blockchain,  

1576
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:44,720
and it’s also the underlying software 
that executes relevant operations.

1577
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:47,120
And that’s kinda really about it.

1578
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:53,760
So just to be very clear here, a conceptual 
DAO consists of three things: people, a digital  

1579
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:59,280
machine built of smart contracts, and a token that 
allows the people to interact with the machine.

1580
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:06,320
In practice most things that call themselves 
DAOs don’t have the machine at all,  

1581
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:12,000
and a substantial number either don’t 
have the token, or only have the token.

1582
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,840
The upside of a DAO is that it makes it 
easy-ish to create a formal organization at  

1583
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:22,480
theoretically any scale, from only a couple 
people to massive pools of stakeholders,  

1584
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:27,200
and the program layer makes it possible to 
automate certain activities and the results.

1585
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:30,160
If the organization votes via the DAO interface,  

1586
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:34,720
the results of that vote are automatically 
recorded, and potentially executed.

1587
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:37,680
Though that framing is misleading.

1588
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:41,440
As with tokens themselves there’s 
no inherent functionality in a DAO,  

1589
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,520
it’s just a box that code goes into.

1590
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:46,880
I might as well be referring to all 
the things you could do with a webpage.

1591
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,160
As already mentioned, many 
organizations presenting  

1592
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:53,360
themselves as a DAO have no 
machine functionality at all.

1593
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:56,720
It’s pretty standard to find a DAO 
that has issued a governance token,  

1594
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:02,080
the scrip that’s used for voting, with the 
systems to actually use that token being placed  

1595
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,960
somewhere in the nebulous future of the roadmap.

1596
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:09,360
That open-endedness is actually important because 
while the claim is that these machines will  

1597
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:14,960
further democratize the internet, the technical 
complexity that they add, the new specialized  

1598
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:19,200
programming expertise that they require, 
concentrates a lot of power in the hands  

1599
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:24,400
of the people who can build the templates that in 
turn enable non-programmers to actually use it.

1600
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:28,400
It’s just laying the seeds for the 
future recreation of the status quo.

1601
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:33,840
The Facebook/Google/Amazon dominated internet 
arose because the technical cost of building a  

1602
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,320
modern website rose far beyond what the 
vast majority of amateurs could manage,  

1603
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:42,480
so everyone moved to templates, and then 
to services, and finally to platforms.

1604
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:45,600
This doesn’t even reset the clock on that,  

1605
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:50,640
the technical cost of creating a DAO is 
already far beyond any casual amateur,  

1606
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:55,440
in part because all of this is being built by 
programmers, and in part because of the stakes.

1607
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:59,680
The only thing this stuff is truly 
good for is managing on-chain assets.

1608
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:05,120
A DAO program can see the state of the chain and 
interact with it, so the DAO humans can vote on  

1609
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:10,240
what should happen to those assets and then the 
DAO program can automatically act on the results.

1610
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:11,840
But that raises the stakes.

1611
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,280
Because a DAO can see and interact directly 
with on-chain assets there’s the risk that via  

1612
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:23,680
bad programming or unforeseen exploits a malicious 
actor can use a DAO to access all kinds of stuff.

1613
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:28,240
The risk is directly proportional to 
the value of the assets kept on-chain,  

1614
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:33,280
and remember, again, that evangelists 
want to put everything on-chain.

1615
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:37,040
The hilarious thing is that this 
has already played out once before.

1616
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:41,440
In fact it played out with the first 
DAO ever built, called The DAO.

1617
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:46,960
This whole story unfolds over the course of 
three months in 2016, from April to June.

1618
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:52,480
The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture capital fund 
that aimed to use code to create an investment  

1619
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:57,360
firm without a conventional management structure 
or board of directors, a scheme that’s positioned  

1620
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,600
as “lightweight” and “reducing bureaucratic 
overhead”, but really it just translated  

1621
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:06,000
to an attempt at minimizing human liability 
for the actions and behaviours of the fund.

1622
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,360
This unparalleled expression of 
greed made the major speculative  

1623
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:12,000
players in Ethereum so horny that during the April  

1624
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,880
and May presale they funneled 14% of the entire 
volume of ether into The DAO’s central wallet.

1625
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:23,840
Now, because The DAO’s underlying code was open 
source, experts and malicious actors alike were  

1626
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:28,560
able to pour over it for vulnerabilities, 
and, indeed, vulnerabilities were found.

1627
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,880
However, because at the end of the day 
fleshy humans are the ones actually pushing  

1628
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:37,440
buttons and making decisions, the actual 
leadership of the nominally-leaderless DAO,  

1629
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:41,280
horny for money and prestige, 
decided to launch in late May anyway.

1630
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,950
Three weeks later The DAO’s programming was 
exploited and the attacker was able to transfer  

1631
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:52,160
1/3rd of The DAO’s funds into a holding wallet, 
about 5% of the entire Ethereum economy,  

1632
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:55,600
valued at the time around 
16 to 17 million dollars.

1633
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:59,040
Now, because this threatened the 
bottom line of capital holders,  

1634
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:03,200
the Ethereum project as a whole, the 
entire thing, was almost immediately  

1635
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,720
forked in order to undo the hack and 
protect the interests of the wealthy.

1636
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:11,200
Ethereum Classic, the arm of the fork that 
didn’t undo the attack, persists to this day,  

1637
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:15,120
though it’s notably less popular despite 
being demonstrably more principled.

1638
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:17,760
Because all the talk about 
“decentralization” is a myth.

1639
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:18,720
It’s just words.

1640
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:23,200
At the end of the day the guys in charge, the guys 
who built the system to serve their interests,  

1641
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:26,000
are still in charge and keep a 
killswitch in their back pocket.

1642
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,920
Crypto is barely a decade old and organizations 
deemed too big to fail already exist.

1643
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,720
The whole fiasco laid out 
the truth from the word go:  

1644
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:39,840
calling a DAO a revolutionary structure is 
smoke and mirrors, it’s just voting shares.

1645
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,120
You might as well call Apple “a bold 
experiment in democracy” because  

1646
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:46,720
a baker’s dozen individuals make 
the decisions instead of just one.

1647
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:50,720
Regardless of the future pitfalls, 
DAOs are also extremely limited.

1648
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,400
They are, again, just code.

1649
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,920
While evangelists promise that they 
can reinvent the social organization,  

1650
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:59,920
mentally consider all the problems, 
conflicts, and decision making that  

1651
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:06,480
social organizations deal with and ask how 
many of those even can be solved by code.

1652
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,440
Some of them can easily be 
turned into computer programs.

1653
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:13,440
Automated bookkeeping, payouts, 
collections, data tracking, sure,  

1654
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:17,040
that’s all stuff organizations 
conceptually can make use of.

1655
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:21,840
But how do you code for the fact that Red 
just really doesn’t get along with Blue?

1656
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:26,000
The pitch promises organizations 
bound by unbreakable rules,  

1657
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,480
but how many organizations actually 
benefit from that level of rigidity?

1658
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:35,280
In particular what happens when the 
version of the rules enforced by code  

1659
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:38,880
run up against a complication 
that the coders didn’t consider?

1660
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,360
What happens if someone with 
legitimate stake in the DAO  

1661
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:44,960
starts spamming the organization’s 
internal systems with bad requests?

1662
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:47,440
What if not enough people participate in voting?

1663
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,600
What if the system locks itself up?

1664
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:51,440
What if the rules are rigged?

1665
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:54,320
What if the system commits a crime?

1666
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:59,360
If this technology did see mass adoption, a future 
timebomb already exists in the fact that very,  

1667
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:04,320
very few of these systems have factored mortality 
into the considerations of their structures,  

1668
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:09,680
because “what if someone with an important token 
dies?” is a really easy thing to overlook when  

1669
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:14,640
you’re the kind of insulated techbro who reinvents 
vending machines and calls them Bodega Boxes.

1670
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:19,920
Now, all of these hypotheticals are technically 
addressable, you can build contingency systems  

1671
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,480
that can account for them, but then 
you need to consider contingencies  

1672
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:28,480
for those contingencies, because what if 
someone uses systems intended for dealing  

1673
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:32,480
with deceased or absentee members to 
expel people they just don’t like?

1674
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,120
And, again, you can only use code to enforce  

1675
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:38,480
interactions that the programmers 
make enforceable via the code.

1676
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:43,680
ConstitutionDAO, a hastily set up scheme to bid on 
one of the few remaining original copies of the US  

1677
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:48,560
constitution, already ran aground most of these 
problems as the project failed to win the auction  

1678
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:54,480
and is now trying to issue refunds, a thing that 
the slapdash machine was never intended to do.

1679
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:58,880
The reality is that most organizations 
with any meaningful social complexity,  

1680
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:05,360
even tiny organizations like video game guilds, 
are too complex to properly express in code.  

1681
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:10,320
There’s too many contingencies and contingencies 
for those contingencies and contingencies for  

1682
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:15,600
those contingencies to account for, so rather 
than trying to turn social interactions into code  

1683
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:21,360
the DAO is marginalized into only handling 
code-appropriate tasks, like bookkeeping,  

1684
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,960
digital signature verification, 
and on-chain asset management.

1685
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:30,480
But that’s not a revolutionary new way to 
organize people, that’s just a productivity tool.

1686
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:34,320
The DAO can have a process for voting on 
actions, but the moment the outcomes of  

1687
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:40,000
those actions move off-chain, i.e. into the 
real world, the DAO program is powerless.

1688
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,680
The program can’t make humans 
execute the decisions of the group,  

1689
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,920
that’s still an analog problem.

1690
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,160
The whole thing very quickly runs into 
an incentive wall where it’s just faster  

1691
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:55,840
and easier to solve problems verbally, via 
abstract trust relationships and promises,  

1692
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,920
to the same end results.

1693
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:02,640
This is why it’s so common for DAOs to not 
actually have any of the inner machine that  

1694
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:07,120
would actually make them into what they 
claim to be: it’s easier to just not.

1695
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:10,400
Taken as a whole DAOs aren’t some 
revolutionary new model, they’re a  

1696
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:15,280
tool built onto the side of cryptocurrency that 
only has meaningful advantages when interacting  

1697
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:20,240
with cryptocurrency as a tool for speculative 
trading and managing financial instruments.

1698
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:25,200
The rest is just a gimmick, a slow, 
inflexible tool for executing straw polls.

1699
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:30,240
Again, a lot of these boil down to a scheme to 
minimize liability on the part of the creators.

1700
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:36,160
The creators of Inu Yasha Token, a meme coin DAO 
based on nothing except the ephemeral concept of  

1701
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:42,080
the InuYasha anime, demonstrated this admirably 
when they were pressed on the issue of copyright,  

1702
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:45,600
openly trading on a known 
brand specifically for clout.

1703
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:50,240
Their answer to the question boils down 
to, one, a failure to understand copyright,  

1704
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:54,320
and two, an insistence that it doesn’t 
matter because no one’s responsible,  

1705
02:05:54,320 --> 02:06:01,760
the DAO did it, no humans are liable, 
just this amorphous sentient carbon cloud.

1706
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:04,240
“You have a really good way 
to explain it about the um  

1707
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,360
about the copyright issue 
that everyone’s afraid of,  

1708
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,640
because they don’t want to invest in a token 
that’s going to be told to cease and desist or..

1709
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:16,320
Right, yeah so I mean, to clear that up 
I think first you need to distinguish  

1710
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:23,760
between a mark and copy. Right? So 
right now on the website there’s,  

1711
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:30,000
it’s all custom art done by Steven. Your 
friend steven. So there is no copy. I mean  

1712
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,480
the only person that can really copyright 
us right now is Steven. Uh. You know?

1713
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:38,080
What about logo likeness or character likeness?

1714
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:47,360
Yeah, so trademarks. Um, it’s possible that the 
InuYasha mark it it could become scrutinized.  

1715
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:55,520
However we’re a decentralized autonomous 
organization officially, and the token is  

1716
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,840
launched on the Ethereum blockchain, so 
there’s, there’s really no going back.  

1717
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:07,040
I’m just a community member. I’m not an 
owner, there’s really no single entity  

1718
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:12,720
that has ownership so I mean it, it’s on 
the blockchain now, there’s no going back.”

1719
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:18,080
And that bit also just so brilliantly demonstrates 
the underlying mentality of a lot of these guys.  

1720
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:23,360
They wanted to use the Inu Yasha brand for 
clout, but they didn’t want to ask for permission  

1721
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:28,480
because they would probably get rejected, 
so they did it anyway, so now that it’s  

1722
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:34,800
“on chain” it can’t be easily taken down, 
so I guess you gotta just let them do it?

1723
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,760
“it’s on the blockchain 
now, there’s no going back.”

1724
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:41,200
Things get funny in that frustrating 
way when you do come across a DAO  

1725
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,320
that’s trying to be legitimate, and 
they tip their hand by revealing that  

1726
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:49,440
underneath they’re legally a co-op or an 
LLC or some other extant legal entity.

1727
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,280
Unless your goal is a grift,  

1728
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:55,840
there’s nothing truly revolutionary 
about their structure or functionality.

1729
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:00,160
Li Jin, the co-founder of a bunch of predatory 
venture capital firms that focus on polishing  

1730
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:05,600
the image of the gig economy to distract from the 
ways in which its eroding labour, has an extended  

1731
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:10,800
Twitter thread where she tries to pitch DAOs as 
the future of unions, though her rationale is not  

1732
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:16,720
only shaky, relying heavily on magical thinking, 
it’s also peppered with inexplicable lies.

1733
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:22,480
For example she champions Yield Guild, a DAO that 
she describes as “a gaming guild comprised of  

1734
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:27,360
thousands of play-to-earn gamers. An onramp that 
brings more players into play-to-earn gaming,  

1735
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,960
it can represent gamers & lobby 
game devs for better policies. 

1736
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:36,000
Its scale also enables the collective to offer 
benefits and protections (e.g. healthcare,  

1737
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,160
paid time off) that would be infeasible 
if gamers were operating on their own.”

1738
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:46,000
This is a tremendous overstatement of what 
Yield actually is. It’s not a union, nor does it  

1739
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,120
function as a union, nor does it have aspirations 
of functioning as a union. It’s not even a DAO,  

1740
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:54,560
though it does have aspirations of 
transitioning into being one. It’s  

1741
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,880
at best a mildly decentralized cartel that’s 
experimenting with shaking down players with  

1742
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:02,720
the promise of helping them by gamifying 
the process of participating in the guild.  

1743
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:06,800
In practice it’s a Discord server that helps 
play-to-earn players find sponsorships,  

1744
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,800
pivot from one game to another, and generally 
bitch about how much their jobs suck.

1745
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,480
In fact, in response to Li Jin’s tweets 
the server residents had this to say

1746
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:19,680
“I've read that through the YGG DAO members 
are able to get access to healthcare -- is  

1747
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:23,040
this true? is there any more info on this? 
anywhere to learn more about what is offered?  

1748
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:27,600
or is this still in the works? as a freelancer 
i'm always interested to learn about more options”

1749
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:32,160
“i actually don't know that lol. that would 
be awesome to get partnered with healthcare”

1750
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:35,280
“Where did you get that info though? 
We haven't heard of any kind about it”

1751
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:42,000
“Hmm yeah I think Li used it as an example of 
potential benefits and didn't mean it literally,  

1752
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,880
but nothing of that sort has been discussed yet”

1753
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:48,400
Now, on a functional level most 
DAOs use an administrative system  

1754
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:52,640
based off the use and spending of 
internal scrip, the governance tokens.

1755
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,560
There’s a decent amount of variability in how 
they’re used, but basically they function either  

1756
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:01,680
as proportional voting power, exactly the same 
as voting shares in a publicly traded company,  

1757
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:06,480
fiat voting power where there’s no point in 
possessing more than one, or direct voting  

1758
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:12,160
power where tokens are spent to cast votes and 
more tokens can be spent to cast more votes.  

1759
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:15,760
Typically this scrip can be bought and 
sold, even on a secondary market, and,  

1760
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,680
indeed, possession of it is typically 
a definitional part of membership.

1761
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,360
Rather than structuring like a union,  

1762
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:24,320
Yield’s overt goal for their DAO 
is to function as a hedge fund,  

1763
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:29,280
using the exchange value of their token as a means 
to raise funds to invest into play-to-earn games,  

1764
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:33,600
and allowing Yield members to spend their tokens 
to gain access to these DAO-owned resources.

1765
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:37,040
In fact Yield is so far removed from 
the purpose and functionality of a union  

1766
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,560
that the roadmap includes potentially 
implementing what’s called holographic  

1767
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,960
consensus, which is a futures market where 
participants gamble on what proposals  

1768
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:50,960
will or won’t be passed using their governance 
tokens as the stakes. It’s amazing if you wanted  

1769
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:55,600
to build a machine whose sole purpose is to 
concentrate political power slowly over time.

1770
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:59,600
Additionally many use a proof-of-stake 
staking system to reward members with  

1771
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:03,760
additional tokens with no gate on how 
many tokens any single member can hold.

1772
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,800
This whole arrangement creates 
a system where participants with  

1773
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:11,440
only a few tokens are incentivized 
to not vote against the interests  

1774
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:16,000
of highly staked members, plus anything 
you spend limits what you can stake,  

1775
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,360
and thus reduces all future income of tokens, 
which means even less voting power in the future.

1776
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:25,680
Members who possess a disproportionate share 
of tokens can afford to out-spend on the  

1777
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:30,160
outcome of any vote AND still retain 
a proportional future voting power.  

1778
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:35,120
At best you end up with high powered voting 
blocs, and at worst a functional monopoly.

1779
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:38,320
The internal discourse of 
Yield is, like all crypto,  

1780
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:42,960
focused on the price of the DAO’s scrip, and not 
it’s actual functionality within the organization.

1781
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:45,520
Rather than creating a more equitable,  

1782
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:49,120
democratic organization that looks 
out for the needs of all its members,  

1783
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:53,840
Yield is a scheme that explicitly rewards its 
highest stakeholders with more power and access.

1784
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:58,560
Now, conceptually you could make a DAO 
that behaves towards actually useful,  

1785
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:04,000
worker-focused goals, but you could also do that 
without a DAO, because it’s just an organization.

1786
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,880
The DAO itself is just a 
mechanism of an organization,  

1787
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,480
and more often than not its involvement 
is little more than tech fetishism.

1788
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:14,400
So most actual DAOs don’t resemble 
anything like a flat hierarchy.

1789
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:18,480
In fact the ability to buy and sell voting 
power, and the hierarchy that results,  

1790
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:23,920
is seen as a strict advantage in that it allows 
emotionally uninvested members to make money  

1791
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:28,240
and gives them a thing that they can reward 
people with that will “align incentives”,  

1792
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:32,640
and despite the fact that Li Jin is directly 
involved with Yield as the “philosopher in  

1793
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:37,680
residence” Yield is neither structured like a 
labour union nor does it have ambitions to be one.

1794
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:42,080
The point is that thought leaders like Li Jin, 
who get a lot of social traction by promising  

1795
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:46,960
that their technofetishistic community are 
solving big societal problems, are liars.

1796
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:50,960
They love the pageantry of democracy because 
it allows them to pretend to be democratic,  

1797
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:54,400
because they can paint their 
detractors as being undemocratic.

1798
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:57,680
It’s all hollow handwaving 
and technobabble to distract  

1799
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:59,600
from the fact that it’s just shareholding.

1800
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:04,240
It’s the corporatization of everything, the 
conversion of the entire world into claves  

1801
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:07,600
governed by power granted via 
token possession and enforced  

1802
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,960
by machines that allow humans to 
wash their hands of the outcomes.

1803
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:15,440
At the end of the day every DAO pretending to 
be useful is still a forced entry point to some  

1804
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:29,840
hype-driven memecoin whose existence only benefits 
its creators and the exchange that sells it.

1805
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:37,360
[Subway rattling]

1806
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:42,400
In 2008 the economy functionally collapsed. 
The basic chain reaction was this:  

1807
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:46,000
bankers took mortgages and turned them 
into something they could gamble on.

1808
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,640
This created a bubble, and then the bubble popped.

1809
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:54,080
When you drill down into it you realize that the 
core of the crypto ecosystem, the core of Web3,  

1810
02:13:54,080 --> 02:14:00,080
the core of the NFT marketplace, is a turf 
war between the wealthy and ultra-wealthy.

1811
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:04,480
Technofetishists who look at people like 
Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, billionaires  

1812
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:08,960
minted via tech industry doors that have 
now been shut by market calcification,  

1813
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,440
and are looking for a do-over, looking 
to synthesize a new market where they  

1814
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:18,960
can be the one to ascend from a merely wealthy 
programmer to a hyper-wealthy industrialist.

1815
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,520
It’s a cat fight between the 5% and the 1%.

1816
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:27,360
Ultimately the driving forces underlying 
this entire movement are economic disparity.

1817
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:32,000
The wealthy and tenuously wealthy are looking for 
a space that they can dominate, where they can be  

1818
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,960
trendsetters and tastemakers and can seemingly 
invent value through sheer force of will.

1819
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,720
This is, in my opinion, the 
blindspot of many casual critics.

1820
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:46,720
The fact that tokens representing ape PFPs 
are useless, yet somehow still expensive,  

1821
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:50,640
isn't an overlooked glitch in 
the system, it's half the point.

1822
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:55,600
It's a digital extension of inconvenient 
fashion. It's a flex and a form of mythmaking.

1823
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,480
And that's how it draws in the bottom: people 
who feel their opportunities shrinking, who see  

1824
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:06,080
the system closing around them, who have become 
isolated by social media and a global pandemic,  

1825
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:11,680
who feel the future getting smaller, people 
pressured by the casualization of work as  

1826
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:17,040
jobs are dissolved into the gig economy, and 
want to believe that escape is just that easy.

1827
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:22,320
All you gotta do is bet on the right Discord and 
you might be air-dropped the next new hotness.

1828
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:25,946
It could be you plucked out of the 
crowd on Rarible and bestowed a six  

1829
02:15:25,946 --> 02:15:28,879
figure price by an elusive Emerati music producer.

1830
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:33,760
Get a BAYC in your wallet, hodl like a 
good diamond hands, and enjoy that yield.

1831
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:39,680
All you need is $5000 in seed money and you can 
buy a Farmer's World milk cow, and if you milk  

1832
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:44,480
that cow every four hours, day and night, for two 
weeks, why there's all your money back right there  

1833
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:49,520
and now it's pure profit (minus, naturally, the 
overhead of all the WAX you needed to stake,  

1834
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:52,400
the barn you needed to buy and build, the 
barley you needed to purchase and grow,  

1835
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:55,760
the food you needed to buy to refill the energy 
you needed to milk the cow, build the barn,  

1836
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:59,440
and grow the barley, plus you actually need to 
cash out which isn't getting paid, it's quitting).

1837
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:03,280
This is your chance to stick it to 
Wall Street and Venture Capitalists,  

1838
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:06,240
as long as you pay no attention 
to the VCs behind the curtain.

1839
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:09,600
The line can only go up.

1840
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:15,040
It’s a movement driven in no small part 
by rage, by people who looked at 2008,  

1841
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:19,200
who looked at the system as it exists, 
but concluded that the problems with  

1842
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:24,000
capitalism were that it didn’t provide 
enough opportunities to be the boot.

1843
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:30,400
And that’s the pitch. Buy in now, buy in early, 
and you could be the high tech future boot.

1844
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:35,600
Our systems are breaking or broken, 
straining under neglect and sabotage,  

1845
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:40,959
and our leaders seem at best complacent, 
willing to coast out the collapse.

1846
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:43,039
We need something better.

1847
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:50,240
But a system that turns everyone into petty 
digital landlords, that distills all interaction  

1848
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:56,398
into transaction, that determines the value 
of something by how sellable it is and whether  

1849
02:16:56,398 --> 02:17:02,638
or not it can be gambled on as a fractional 
tokens sold via micro-auction, that’s not it.

1850
02:17:02,639 --> 02:17:05,919
A different system does not 
inherently mean a better system,  

1851
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:08,719
we replace bad systems with 
worse ones all the time.

1852
02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:13,199
We replaced a bad system of work and 
bosses with a terrible system of apps,  

1853
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:15,120
gigs, and on-demand labour.

1854
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:20,639
So it’s not just that I oppose NFTs because 
the foremost of them are aesthetically vacuous  

1855
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:24,719
representations of the dead inner lives 
of the tech and finance bros behind them,  

1856
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:27,759
it’s that they represent the 
vanguard of a worse system.

1857
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:32,080
The whole thing, from OpenSea fantasies 
for starving artists to the buy-in for  

1858
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:37,760
Play to Earn games, it's the same hollow, 
exploitative pitch as MLMs. It's Amway,  

1859
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:41,840
but everywhere you look people 
are wearing ugly-ass ape cartoons.
